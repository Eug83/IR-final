4 Non Blondes - What's up

[00:30]25 years of my life and still
[00:34]I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
[00:40]For a destination
[00:44]I realized quickly when I knew I should
[00:48]That the world was made up of this
[00:51]Brotherhood of man
[00:54]For whatever that means
[00:58]So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed
[01:02]To get it all out what's in my head
[01:06]Then I start feeling a little peculiar
[01:13]So I wake in the morning and I step
[01:16]Outside I take deep breath
[01:18]I get real high
[01:20]Then I scream from the top of my lungs
[01:23]What's goin' on
[01:27]And I say hey...
[01:34]And I say hey what's goin' on
[01:41]And I say hey...
[01:48]I said hey what's goin' on
[02:24]And I try, oh my God do I try
[02:30]I try all the time
[02:33]In this institution
[02:38]And I pray, oh my God do I pray
[02:44]I pray every single day
[02:48]For a revolution
[02:53]So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed
[02:56]To get it all out what's in my head
[03:00]Then I start feeling a little peculiar
[03:07]So I wake in the morning and I step outside
[03:10]I take a deep breaththen I get real high
[03:14]Then I scream from the top of my lungs
[03:17]What's goin' on
[03:20]And I say hey...
[03:28]And I say hey what's goin' on
[03:34]And I say hey...
[03:42]I said hey what's goin' on
[03:48]And I say hey...
[03:56]And I say hey what's goin' on
[04:02]And I say hey...
[04:10]I said hey what's goin' on
[04:32]25 years of my life and still
[04:37]I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
[04:43]For a destination
