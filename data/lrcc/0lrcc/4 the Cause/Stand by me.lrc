4 The Cause - Stand by me

[00:22][00:08][00:03]When the night has come
[00:29][00:11][00:06]And the land is dark
[00:32][00:13]And the moon is the only light we'll see
[00:42]No I won't be afraid
[00:46]Oh I won't be afraid
[00:52]Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[01:00]So darlin' darlin' stand by me
[01:08]Oh stand by me
[01:12]Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[01:23]If the sky that we look upon
[01:28]Should tumble and fall
[01:33]Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
[01:43]I won't cry, I won't cry
[01:48]No I won't shed a tear
[01:53]Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[02:01]And darlin' darlin' stand by me
[02:07]Oh stand by me
[02:13]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
[02:21]
[02:42]Darlin' darlin' stand by me
[02:49]Oh stand by me
[02:54]Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

[03:22]Darlin' darlin' stand by me
[03:29]Oh stand by me
[03:34]Just as long as you stand, stand by me
