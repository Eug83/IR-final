[00:18]From the first day that I saw your smiling face
[00:26]Honey I knew that we would be together forever
[00:34]When I asked you out, you said no, but I found out
[00:43]Darling you'd been hurt, you felt that you'd never love again
[00:53]I deserve a try, honey, just once
[00:58]Give me a chance, and I'll prove this all wrong
[01:01]You walked in you were quick to judge
[01:06]But honey, he's nothing like me
[04:10][03:52][03:34][02:59][02:41][01:28][01:09]I'll never break your heart
[04:14][03:56][03:39][03:03][02:45][01:32][01:14]I'll never make you cry
[04:18][04:01][03:43][03:07][02:50][01:36][01:19]I'd rather die, then live without you
[04:23][04:06][03:48][03:12][02:55][01:41][01:23]I'll give you all of me, honey that's no lie
[01:47]As time goes by you will get to know me
[01:55]A little more better, girl that's the way love goes
[02:04]And I know your afraid, to let your feelings show
[02:12]And I understand, but girl it's time to let go
[02:22]I deserve a try honey, just once
[02:27]Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
[02:30]You walked in you were so quick to judge
[02:35]But honey he's nothing like me
[02:38]Darling why can't you see
