[01:18]
[03:55][01:57]When I'm walking down the street
[03:59][02:00]All the glass boxes round n' round
[04:02][02:04]Oh that's what I have to bear
[04:06][02:07]Super building catch the air
[04:09][02:11]Crazy traffic from East to West
[04:12][02:14]I'll be in madness, I don't care
[02:34]Never never, shine on me
[02:38]In the forest, got no trees
[02:41]Oh that's what I have to hear
[02:44]Super building, on my head
[02:48]In the city, I can't feel good
[02:51]I'll be in madness, I don't care
