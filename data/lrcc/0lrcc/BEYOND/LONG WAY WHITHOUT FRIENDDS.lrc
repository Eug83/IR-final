[00:34]
[01:13]The sun is scorching down, 
[01:15]And the sand reflect its light.
[01:19]I'm moving with my shadow, 
[01:21]Through this empty haunted land.
[01:24]Strange sounds from nowhere, 
[01:26]And the strong wind cut my face. 
[01:29]Nobody'll help But what else can I do ? 
[05:10][02:17][01:34]Oh! Lord I need your help,
[05:14][02:22][01:39]In the sky there's a eagle soaring by!
[05:20][02:28][01:45]Oh, Long way without friends,
[05:25][02:32][01:50]But I'll never, never change my mind!
[01:56]The moon is hanging high, 
[01:58]With her lonely stars behind, 
[02:01]The moonlinght lit the ground. 
[02:03]The moonlight give me a chill,
[02:07]But only the moonlight,Will show me my way
[02:12]Nobody'll help,But what else can i do? 
[04:49]The gift is in my hands, 
[04:51]And the road before my eyes,
[04:54]The fire has ceased to burn.
[04:56]I can feel the torture's gone.
[04:59]But will it last for long,
[05:01]when the spell is still around.
[05:05]Nobody care,But what else can I do?
