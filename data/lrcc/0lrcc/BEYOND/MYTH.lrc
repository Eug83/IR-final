[00:12]詞 \ 陳時安.   曲 \ 黃家駒.陳時安.  主唱 \ 黃家駒.

[00:37]It was a story told for years
[00:45]When a young girl dwelled this land
[00:49]With eyes shone like the star
[00:53]And a smile that charmed both heaven and earth           
[01:00]The moon was ashamed when next to her
[01:07]And the flowers bowed their heads
[01:12]Her songs could tame the beasts
[01:16]Her hands could wave all sorrows away
[02:01][01:23]Yet that Fate was envy 'bout this girl'
[02:08][01:30]And a plot was planned to lay her down
[01:38]To a pasture she was led
[01:46]Where the grass was always green
[01:50]In the midst of this wonderland
[01:54]Stood the plant that'd bring her permanent end
[02:49]The plant of death was in her eyes
[02:56]Sending its fragrant through the air
[03:00]Laughter form below was heard   
[03:07]With a touch the task was done
[03:15]Like an arrow it speared her heart
[03:19]Like venom it killed her light  
[03:27]As her body slowly dropped 
[03:34]Stopped the singing from around 
[03:38]Her soul left without a sound 
[04:39]The god of love was deeply hurt 
[04:47]When the tragedy was known 
[04:51]It cut right into his heart
[04:58]With tears and pain he flew to her
[05:05]To end this sorrow he drawn his sword 
[05:10]How red the blood that sprayed around 
[05:17]As the thorns grew around it stem 
[05:24]And the petals stained in red 
[05:29]Turned the plant into a rose 
[05:53]
