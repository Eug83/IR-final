[00:16]
[00:22]Alone, drowning in the sea
[00:28]The voice of silence soon will set me free
[00:33]The soul, in depths so low
[00:39]Feels the pain but got no place to go
[01:52][00:45]Though it hurts so much
[01:55][00:48]you left me out of touch
[01:57][00:50]But I'll walk the road to the way
[01:59][00:52]'cause you believe
[03:12][02:49][02:01][00:54]Oh paradise
[03:17][02:54][02:06][00:59]Seek and you shall find
[03:20][02:57][02:09][01:02]but somehow I was left behind
[03:23][03:00][02:13][01:05]Oh paradise
[03:28][03:05][02:18][01:10]Seek and you shall find
[03:31][03:08][02:20][01:13]if only it would be my time
[01:29]I cried to no one there
[01:35]Echoes remind me what sins I must bear
[01:40]The scars they are my prize
[01:47]Paid the dues though no one realizes
