[00:31]You get inside of me and I don't even
[00:36](Know how to act, girl)
[00:37]You have a synergy that gets in me that's
[00:40](That's better than sex)
[00:41]When we get intimate it's got to be
[00:44](As good as it gets)
[00:45]And I just can't wait to get home
[00:49]Your sexuality it smothers me and
[00:52](And less I forget)
[00:53]My own reality is fantasy it's
[00:56](I just got to admit)
[00:57]That I desire you and think of you like

[01:52]And I just can't wait to get home
[01:55]Your sexuality it captures me
