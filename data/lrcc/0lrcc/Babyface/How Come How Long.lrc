[00:00][05:00]Babyface--How Come,How Long 

[00:24]There was a girl I used to know
[00:27]She was oh so beautiful
[00:30]But she's not here anymore
[00:35]She had a college degree
[00:39]Smart as anyone could be
[00:42]She had so much to live for
[00:46]But she fell in love with the wrong kinda man
[00:52]He abused her love and treated her so bad
[00:58]There was not enough education in her world
[01:04]that could save life of this little girl

[01:10][02:33][04:08]How come, how long
[01:13][02:36][04:11]It's not right, it's so wrong
[01:16][02:39][04:14]Do we let it just go on
[01:19][02:42][04:17]Turn our backs and carry on
[01:22][02:45][04:20]Wake up, for it's too late
[01:25][02:48][04:23]Right now, we can't wait
[01:28][02:51][04:26]She won't have a second try
[01:31][02:54][04:29]Open up your hearts
[01:33][02:56][04:31]As well as your eyes

[01:46]She tried to give a cry for help
[01:50]she even blamed things on herself
[01:53]But no one came to her aid
[01:59]Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell
[02:02]That's what we'd like to tell our self
[02:05]But no !it wasn't that way
[02:09]So she fell in love
[02:12]With the wrong kinda man
[02:15]And she paid with her life for loving that man
[02:21]So we cannot ignore,we must look for the signs
[02:27]And maybe next time we must save somebody's life
