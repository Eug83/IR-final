[00:15]Sitting by the window
[00:19]All day thinking of you
[00:23]Watching the days go by

[00:34]They only meant I love you
[00:38]And I wanna tell you girl that I, oh I

[01:26]Letting my life pass me by
[01:31]Believing you're with me
[01:34]Well I can't speak for no one
[01:38]But in my heart I know you love me
[01:42]And that's why I'll always tell you I
