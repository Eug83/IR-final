[00:00][04:20]Babyface--The Day (That You Gave Me A Son) 

[00:18]'T was late December the news came
[00:30]And I got so excited, I cried all day
[00:43]And you were such a lovely, precious sight
[00:52]When I saw our baby in your eyes

[01:00][02:17][03:30]It was like falling deep in love
[01:07][02:24][03:38]I heard the angels cry above
[01:14][02:31][03:45]I felt a blessing straight from God
[01:21][02:38][03:52]The day that you gave me a son

[01:35]I called 'bout everyone I knew
[01:46]Just think, I'll be a father 'cause of you
[02:00]There's no greater love than what you gave
[02:10]A brand new baby on the way

[02:57]Oh such tears of joy, I've never known
[03:05]I can't remember
[03:09]It's like a song, I've never heard
[03:16]I've never sung, but know the words
