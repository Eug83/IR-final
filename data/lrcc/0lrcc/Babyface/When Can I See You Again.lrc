When Can I See You Again

This Is For The Cool
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[00:12]When can my heart beat again
[00:18]When does the pain ever end
[00:23]When do the tears stop from running over
[00:29]When does "you'll get over it" begin
[00:35]I hear what you're saying
[00:36]But I swear that it's not making sense
[00:43]So when can I see you

[01:57][00:49]When can I see you again
[02:02][00:54]When can my heart beat again
[02:08][01:00]When can I see you again
[02:14][01:05]When can I breathe once again
[01:14]And when can I see you
[02:22]And when can I see you... again

[01:20]When does my "someday" begin
[01:26]When I'll find someone again
[01:31]And what if I still am not truly over
[01:37]What am I supposed to do then, babe...
[01:43]Do you see what I'm saying
[01:45]Even if, if it's not making sense
[01:51]So when can I see you

[02:37]Yeah, baby
[02:40]Do you see what I'm saying
[02:41]Even if, if it's not making sense, baby
[02:47]So when can I see you again

[02:51]When can I see you again
[02:56]Can my heart beat again, baby
[03:02]When can I see you again
[03:07]And when can I breathe once again
[03:16]And when can I see, babe, again

[03:32]Wanna see you again
[03:38]Again....
