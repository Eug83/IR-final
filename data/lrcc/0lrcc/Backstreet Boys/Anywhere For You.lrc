[00:07]I'd go anywhere for you
[00:11]Anywhere you asked me to
[00:15]I'd do anything for you
[00:18]Anything you want me to
[00:37]I'd walk halfway around the world
[00:42]For just one kiss from you
[00:45]Far beyond the call of love
[00:49]The sun, the stars, the moon
[00:52]As long as your love's there to lead me
[00:56]I won't lose my way, believe me
[01:00]Even trough the darkest night you know
[03:10][02:17][01:06]I'd go anywhere for you
[03:47][03:14][02:22][01:10]Anywhere you asked me to
[03:51][03:17][02:26][01:14]I'd do anything for you
[03:55][03:22][02:30][01:17]Anything you want me to
[03:59][03:26][02:34][01:22]Your love as far as I can see
[04:03][03:30][02:38][01:26]Is all I'm ever gonna need
[04:09][03:33][02:41][01:30]There's one thing for sure
[04:11][03:36][02:44][01:31]I know it's true
[04:17][03:41][02:49][01:37]Baby, I'd go anywhere for you
[01:50]I used to think that dreams were just
[01:54]For sentimental fools
[01:57]And I'd never find someone
[02:01]Who'd give their love so true
[02:04]But I knew the very minute
[02:08]Couldn't live my life without you in it
[02:12]And now I want the whole wide world
[02:15]To know
[02:57]Hey baby,hey baby, hey baby, oohhh
[03:04]Hey baby,hey baby, oohhh
