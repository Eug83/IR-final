Backstreet Boys - As Long As You Love Me

[00:19]Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
[00:24]I'm leaving my life in your hands
[00:30]People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
[00:34]Risking it all in a glance
[00:39]How you got me blind is still a mystery
[00:44]I can't get you out of my head
[00:49]Don't care what is written in you history
[00:54]As long as you're here with me

[02:45][01:36][00:58]I don't care who you are
[02:48][01:40][01:01]Where you're from
[03:30][03:11][02:51][01:42][01:04]What you did
[02:53][01:45][01:06]As long as you love me
[03:25][03:25][03:17][03:07][02:56][01:47][01:08]Who you are
[03:19][03:09][02:58][01:50][01:11]Where you're from
[03:01][01:52][01:13]Don't care what you did
[03:33][03:27][03:22][03:14][03:03][01:54][01:15]As long as you love me

[01:19]Every little thing that you have said and done
[01:23]Feels like it's deep within me
[01:28]Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
[01:33]It seems like we're meant to be

[02:17]I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
[02:21]But I guess it shows
[02:24]When you look in to my eyes
[02:27]What you did and where you're comin from
[02:31]I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

[03:32]I Don't Care
