[00:13.80]Remember when
[00:16.96]we never needed each other
[00:20.40]The best of friends like
[00:24.00]Sister and Brother
[00:26.70]We understood, we'd never be,
[00:34.40]Alone

[00:39.50]Those days are gone, and I want so much
[00:46.00]The night is long and I need your touch
[00:51.10]Don't know what to say
[00:54.00]I never meant to feel this way
[01:54.20][00:57.29]Don't want to be
[01:57.70][01:00.56]Alone tonight

[03:18.79][02:54.26][02:02.80][01:06.00]What can I do, to make it right
[03:24.77][03:00.37][02:09.00][01:12.01]Falling so hard so fast this time
[03:06.43][02:15.15][01:18.35]What did I say, what did you do?
[03:12.60][02:21.23][01:24.54]How did I fall in love with you?

[01:36.80]I hear your voice
[01:40.07]And I start to tremble
[01:43.44]Brings back the child that, I resemble
[01:48.80]I cannot pretend, that we can still be friends

[02:26.90]Oh I want to say this right
[02:30.20]And it has to be tonight
[02:33.50]Just need you to know, oh yeah

[02:37.90]I don't want to live this life
[02:41.00]I don't want to say goodbye
[02:44.28]With you I wanna spend
[02:47.30]The rest of my life

[03:30.40]Everything's changed, we never knew

[03:37.70]How did I fall
[03:42.23]in love 
[03:46.10]with you?
