[00:11.80]Even a lover makes a mistake sometimes
[00:23.37]Like any other
[00:26.50]Fall out and lose his mind
[00:33.79]And I'm sorry for the things I did
[00:40.05]For your teardrops over words I said
[02:00.89][00:47.08]Can you forgive me 
[02:03.40][00:50.10]and open your heart once again
[02:08.67][00:54.70]oh yeah

[03:28.24][03:04.60][02:11.60][00:58.00]It's true
[03:31.00][03:07.70][02:14.60][01:00.66]I mean it
[03:34.67][03:10.89][02:17.91][01:04.21]From the bottom of my heart
[03:39.50][03:15.80][02:22.60][01:08.80]Yeah, it's true
[03:43.14][03:19.50][02:26.10][01:12.55]Without you I would fall apart
[03:53.99][02:37.12][01:22.90]
[01:25.10]Whatever happened
[01:28.20]I know that I was wrong, oh yes
[01:36.99]Can you believe me
[01:40.36]Maybe your faith is gone
[01:47.40]But I love you and I always will
[01:53.90]So I wonder if you want me still

[02:45.75]I'd do anything to make it up to you
[02:52.22]So please understand
[02:56.80]And open your heart once again
