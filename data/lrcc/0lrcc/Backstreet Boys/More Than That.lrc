[00:05.65]I can see that you've been crying
[00:11.70]You can't hide it with a lie
[00:17.51]What's the use in you denying
[00:22.70]The words you have at home

[00:29.47]I heard him promise you forever
[00:35.55]But forevers come and go
[00:41.44]Baby he would say whatever
[00:46.40]It takes to keep you alive
[00:52.30]Tell the truth between the lines

[03:10.20][02:45.60][00:57.90]Oh I will love you more than that
[01:54.60]And I will love you more than that
[03:15.30][02:51.40][02:39.43][02:00.60][01:04.00]I won't say those words, then take them back
[03:22.20][02:58.34][02:07.50][01:10.67]Don't give loneliness a chance
[03:27.60][03:03.70][02:12.90][01:16.25]Baby listen to me when I say
[03:31.79][03:07.91][02:34.10][01:20.20]I will love you more than that
[03:36.00]
[01:26.20]Baby you deserve much better
[01:32.17]What's the use in holding on
[01:38.29]Don't you see it's now or never
[01:43.20]Just why you can't be friends
[01:48.90]Baby knowing in the end

[02:18.40]There's not a day that passes by
[02:22.00]I don't wonder why we haven't tried
[02:24.90]It's not too late to change your mind
[02:28.20]And take my hand, don't say goodbye
