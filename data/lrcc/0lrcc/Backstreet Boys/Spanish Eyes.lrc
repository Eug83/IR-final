[00:00]Backstreet Boys---Spanish Eyes


[00:16]Here we are in the arms of one another 
[00:23]And we still go on searching for each other 
[00:29]Knowing that hate is wrong 
[00:33]and love is right for us tonight 
[00:41]When I look into your Spanish eyes 
[00:48]I know the reason why I am alive 
[00:55]And the world is so beautiful tonight 

CHORUS 
[01:00]It's a place I've never been 
[01:03]And it comes from deep within 
[01:07]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize 
[01:14]Knowing all I have to do 
[01:17]Is reach out my hand to you 
[01:21]Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes 

[01:30]Let it be if nothing more than dreamers 
[01:37]Who believe that we see no wall between us 
[01:44]How can they be in my heart and in my mind 
[01:51]when all I could find 

[01:55]When I look into your Spanish eyes 
[02:03]I know the reason why I am alive 
[02:10]And the world is so beautiful tonight 

CHORUS 
[02:14]It's a place I've never been 
[02:18]And it comes from deep within 
[02:22]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize 
[02:29]Knowing all I have to do 
[02:32]Is reach out my hand to you 
[02:36]Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes 

[02:45]I loved you from a distance thought
[02:49]I couldn't reach that far 
[02:52]I can't believe how close that we are 
[02:59]When I look into your Spanish eyes 
[03:10]And the world is so beautiful tonight 

CHORUS 
[03:15]It's a place I've never been 
[03:18]And it comes from deep within 
[03:22]And it's telling me that I'm about to win first prize 
[03:29]Knowing all I have to do 
[03:33]Is reach out my hand to you 
[03:36]Anytime I want to look into your Spanish eyes
[03:46]oh..yeah...
