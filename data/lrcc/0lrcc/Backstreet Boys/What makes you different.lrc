[00:00]What makes you different
[00:06]Backstreet boys 
ê› 
[00:09]You don't run with the crowd, you go your own way
[00:15]You don't play after dark, you light up my day
[00:20]Got your own kind of style that sets you apart
[00:24]Baby,that's why you captured my heart
[00:29]I know sometimes you feel like you don't fit in
[00:34]And this world doesn't know what you have within
[00:39]When I look at you I see something rare
[00:44]A rose that can grow anywhere
[00:49]And there's no one I know that can compare
[02:37][02:08][01:49][00:54]What makes you different,makes you beautiful
[02:43][01:53][00:59]What's there inside you shines through to me 
[02:49][01:57][01:03]In your eyes I see all the love I'll ever need
[02:59][01:14]What make you different
[03:00][01:16]Makes you beautiful to me
[01:25]You got something so real, you touched me so deep
[01:29]You see material things don't matter to me
[01:34]So come as you are,your've got nothing to prove
[01:38]You won me with all that you do
[01:43]And I wanna take this chance to say to you

[02:13]You don't know how you touch my life
[02:17]Oh,in so many ways I just can't describe
[02:23]You taught me what love is supposed to be
[02:28]It's all the little things that make you beautiful to me
