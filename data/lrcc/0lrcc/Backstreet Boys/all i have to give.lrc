[00:00] All I Have To Give  §@ªÌ¡Geggstar

[00:10]I don't know what he does to make you cry
[00:16]But I'll be there to make you smile
[00:20]I don't have a fancy car,
[00:24]To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles
[00:30]I don't care if he buys you nice things
[00:35]Does his gifts come from the heart - I don't know....
[00:42]But if you were my girl.....
[00:44]I'd make it so that we'd never be apart

Chorus:
[04:07][03:47][03:22][03:02][01:49][00:49]But my love is all I have to give
[04:12][03:51][03:26][03:06][01:54][00:54]Without you I don't think I can live
[04:16][03:57][03:31][03:11][01:59][00:59]I wish I could give the world to you....but
[04:22][04:01][03:37][03:17][02:04][01:04]Love is all I have to give

[01:10]When you talk - does it seem like he's not
[01:15]Even listening to a word you say?
[01:20]That's okay, babe, just tell me your problems
[01:24]I'll try my best to kiss them all away.....
[01:30]Does he leave when you need him the most?
[01:35]Does his friends get all your time?
[01:40]Baby please....I'm on my knees
[01:44]Praying for the day that you'll be mine

(Chorus)

Bridge:
[02:10]To you...hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more - inside
[02:20]All the money in the world could never add up to all the love
[02:29]I have inside....I love you
