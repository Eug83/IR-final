  [01:35.00]但如果你知道它反映的是某次吸毒後的情景,
  [02:00.00]就可以很好的了解歌詞大意了！
  [02:09.65]On a dark desert highway.
  [02:12.95]Cool wind in my hair.
  [02:16.04]Warm smell of colitas.
  [02:19.07]Rising up through the air.
  [02:22.19]Up ahead in the distance.
  [02:25.54]I saw a shimmering light.
  [02:28.84]My head grew heavy & my sight grew dim.
  [02:31.83]I had 2 stop 4 the night.
  [02:35.12]There she stood in the doorway.
  [02:38.42]I heard the mission bell.
  [02:42.00]And I was thinking 2 myself.
  [02:43.60]"This could B Heaven or this could B Hell".
  [02:47.92]Then she lit up a candle.
  [02:51.04]And she showed me the way.
  [02:54.37]There were voices down the corridor.
  [02:57.49]I thought I heard them say.
  [04:17.44][03:00.63]Welcome 2 the Hotel California ! 
  [04:22.95][03:06.08]Such a lovely place ! 
  [04:26.12][03:07.86]Such a lovely face ! 
  [03:13.42]Plenty of room at the Hotel California !
  [03:19.55]Any time of year.
  [03:22.47]U can find it here !
  [03:26.41]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,
  [03:29.50]She got the Mercedes bends.
  [03:32.71]She got a lot of pretty,pretty boys.
  [03:35.07]That she calls friends.
  [03:39.30]How they dance in the courtyard.
  [03:42.00]Sweet summer sweat.
  [03:45.52]Some dance 2 remember ! 
  [03:48.64]Some dance 2 forget ! 
  [03:51.95]So I called up the Captain.
  [03:55.01]"Please bring me my wine." 
  [03:56.58]He said"We haven't had that spirit here."
  [03:59.72]"Since nineteen sixty nine." 
  [04:04.73]And still those voices are calling from far away.
  [04:11.11]Wake U up in the middle of the night.
  [04:14.24]Just 2 hear them say-
  [04:29.90]They livin' it up at the Hotel California.
  [04:35.87]What a nice surprise ! 
  [04:38.97]Bring Ur alibis.
  [04:43.28]Mirrors on the ceiling.
  [04:46.47]The pink champagne on ice.
  [04:48.77]And she said"We are all just prisoners here-
  [04:52.65]-of our own device".
  [04:56.32]And in the master's chambers.
  [04:59.33]They gathered 4 the feast.
  [05:02.42]They stabbed it with their steely knives.
  [05:05.60]But they just can't kill the beast.
  [05:08.97]Last thing I rememberv.
  [05:11.94]I was running 4 the door.
  [05:15.41]I had 2 find the passage back.
  [05:18.08]To the place I was before.
  [05:21.74]"Relax",said the night man.
  [05:24.69]"We are programmed 2 receive."
  [05:28.36]U can checkout any time U like."
  [05:31.74]But U can never leave!"
