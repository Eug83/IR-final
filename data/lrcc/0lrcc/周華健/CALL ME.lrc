[00:34.25]Rain began to fall softly as she gazed around the room.
[00:42.26]Even now she wondered what went wrong.
[00:50.33]A letter in her hand trembled as she placed it by the phone.
[00:58.15]All at once there were footsteps by the door.
[01:04.99]She didn't want a confrontation to tear them apart.
[01:13.84]She wasn't sure of all the feeling's racing through her heart.

[01:22.81]I looked into her eyes knowing something wasn't right.
[01:31.01]And suddenly the tears began to show.
[01:37.87]Babe, I know that it's wrong.
[01:41.13]But you know I'm really not that strong.
[01:46.28]How I wish I could tell you that I am.
[01:52.82]But before I even read this letter, I want you to stay.
[02:01.80]But if I see your mind's made up,
[02:05.47]there's one thing I've got to say.
[02:09.33]You can call me, baby, if you ever change your mind.
[02:18.21]Believe me when I say to you, anytime will be alright.
[02:25.29]You can call me. Only seven numbers on the phone.
[02:34.24]Maybe we can talk things over.
[02:40.00]You're never that far from home.
[02:43.82]Oh no, no, baby you're not alone.

[02:58.66]Another season. Another change.
[03:06.71]Two hearts are breaking with no one to blame.
[03:14.03]I know the reasons you want to go.
[03:22.20]But if you find that you still want me,
[03:25.71]there's one thing that you should know.
[03:29.23]You can call me, baby, if you ever change your mind.
[03:38.04]Believe me when I say to you, anytime will be alright.
[03:45.55]You can call me. Only seven numbers on the phone.
[03:54.56]Maybe we can talk things over.
[04:00.00]You're never that far from home. Oh no, no, woo, woo

[04:09.97]You can call me, baby, if you ever change your mind.
[04:18.18]Believe me when I say to you, anytime will be alright.
[04:25.59]You can call me. Only seven numbers on the phone.
[04:34.54]Maybe we can talk things over.
[04:39.28]You're never that far from home. Oh no, no, woo, woo
[04:50.01]You can call me, baby, if you ever change your mind.
