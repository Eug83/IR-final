[00:13.49]We remember the days,
[00:15.48]We sat out together with faith?
[00:20.30]Remember the times, so fine,
[00:24.09]When we thought that nothing could stand in our way?

[00:29.19]Then things weren't the same,
[00:31.98]The life that we knew had to change
[00:36.02]We've struggled through the darkest storms,
[00:40.75]We thought we couldn't tame
[00:45.11]Together we've tried,
[00:47.90]As we stood side by side
[00:52.13]I knew we'd build a new world,
[00:54.78]A world of hope forever after

[02:35.56][01:00.28]Deep in my heart I just know,
[02:39.51][01:04.01]right from the start we will grow
[02:43.82][01:08.03]Look where we are,
[02:45.58][01:11.05]we've come so far and there's still a long long way to go
[03:23.28][02:51.42][01:16.03]All of my heart, I will care.
[02:55.49][01:20.10]I'll play my part, I will share
[02:59.38][01:23.97]With family and friends,together we'll stand
[03:35.25][03:03.40][01:28.36]And in the end, hand in hand, 
[03:39.50][03:07.47][01:31.84]We will get there

[01:48.93]So now we begin, working together to win
[01:55.58]Believing in trust, it must be possible to overcome anything.
[02:04.24]There's so much to do,
[02:07.14]There's so much we can contribute
[02:12.14]By sharing just a little love,
[02:16.52]We will start again a new
[02:20.65]So why don't we try?
[02:23.99]If we stand side by side
[02:27.86]I know we'll build a new world,
[02:30.31]A world of hope for ever after
