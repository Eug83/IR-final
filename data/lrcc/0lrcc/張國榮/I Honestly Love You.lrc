[00:26.65]Maybe I hang around here a little more than I should
[00:33.32]We both know I got some where else to go
[00:40.91]But I got something to tell you
[00:44.74]That I never thought I would
[00:48.30]But I believe you really ought to know
[00:56.12]I love you
[01:02.05]I honestly love you
[01:12.05]You don't have to answer
[01:14.95]I see it in your eyes
[01:18.30]Maybe it was better left unsaid
[01:25.94]But this is pure and simple, and you must realise
[01:32.59]That it's comin' from my heart and not my head
[01:42.15]I Love You
[01:48.00]I honestly love you
[01:56.26]I'm not tryin' to make you feel uncomfortable
[02:03.27]I'm not tryin' to make you anything at all
[02:09.50]But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
[02:17.30]And you shouldn't blow the chance
[02:20.47]when you've got the chance to say
[02:27.26]I love you
[02:34.95]I love you
[02:39.14]I honestly love you
[02:45.27]
[02:48.43]If we both were born in another place and time
[02:54.85]This moment might be ending in a kiss
[03:02.62]But there you are with yours
[03:05.48]And here I am with mine
[03:09.03]So I guess we'll just be leavin' it at this
[03:18.50]I love you
[03:24.18]I honestly love you
[03:31.67]I honestly love you
