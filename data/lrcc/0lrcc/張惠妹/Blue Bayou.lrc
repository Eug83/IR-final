[00:10.83]I feel so bad i got a worried mind 
[00:16.38]I`m so lonesome all the time 
[00:21.46]Since i left my baby behind on blue bayou 
[00:29.26]Saving nickels,saving dimes 
[00:36.78]Working`til the sun don`t shine 
[00:41.69]Looking forward to happier times on blue bayou 
[02:11.90][00:49.69]I`m going back some day come what may to blue bayou 
[02:22.93][01:00.95]Where the folks are fine and world is mine on blue bayou 
[02:33.12][01:11.09]where those fishing boats with their sails float 
[02:38.61][01:16.89]If i could only see that familiar sunrise 
[02:46.40][01:24.69]Through sleepy eyes how happy I`ll be 
[01:32.75]Gonna see my baby again 
[01:38.18]Gonna be with some of my friends 
[01:43.48]Maybe i`ll feel better again on blue bayou 
[01:52.31]Saving nickels,saving dimes 
[01:58.48]Workimng`til the sun don`t shine 
[02:03.49]Looking forward to happier times on blue bayou

[03:14.12]Oh,that boy of mine by my side 
[03:19.96]Tht silver moon and the evening tide 
[03:24.70]Oh,some sweet day going to take away 
[03:29.94]This hurting inside 
[03:34.11]Well,i`ll never be blue 
[03:37.59]My dreams come true on blue bayou
