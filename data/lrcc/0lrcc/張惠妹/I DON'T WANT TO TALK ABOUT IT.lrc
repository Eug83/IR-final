[00:00]I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT 
[00:16]
[00:32]I can tell by your eyes  
[00:37]that you're probably 
[00:39]being crying forever 
[00:48]And the stars in the sky 
[00:53]don't mean nothing to you 
[00:57]they are mirrors
[00:59]
[03:42][02:25][01:06]I don't wanna 
[03:46][02:28][01:10]talk about it 
[03:49][02:32][01:14]how you broke my heart 
[03:57][02:40][01:22]If I stay here just a little bit longer 
[04:04][02:47][01:29]If I stay here won't you listen to my heart 
[04:18][03:01][01:42]Oh my heart
[04:24][03:09][01:47]
[01:51]If I stand all alone 
[01:55]will the shadow hide the colors 
[02:00]of my heart
[02:07]Still the stars in the sky 
[02:11]don't mean nothing to you 
[02:15]they are mirrors
[02:19]
