[00:00]The whispers in the morning 
[00:00]THE POWER OF LOVE 
[00:00]
[00:07]of lovers sleeping tight. 
[00:14]Are rolling like thunder now 
[00:21]as I look in your eyes.
[00:28]I hold on to your body 
[00:34]and feel each move you make.
[00:41]Your voice is warm and tender 
[00:46]A love that I could not forsake.

[03:42][02:17][00:55]Cause I am your lady 
[03:49][02:23][01:01]And you are my man.
[03:56][02:30][01:09]Whenever you reach for me 
[04:02][02:37][01:15]I'll do all that I can.
[04:02][02:37][01:20]
[04:09][02:44]We're heading for something 
[04:16][02:51]Somewhere I've never been.
[04:23][02:58]Sometimes I am frightened but 
[04:26][03:01]I'm ready to learn 
[04:30][03:05]of the power of love.
[04:58][04:44][04:37]the power of love
[01:22]Lost is how I'm feeling 
[01:29]lying in your arms.
[01:36]When the world outside's too much to take.
[01:42]That all ends when I'm with you.
[01:49]Even though there may be times 
[01:56]it seems I'm far away.
[02:03]Never wonder where I am 
[02:07]cause I am always by your side.
[05:06][03:09]
[03:15]The sound of your heart beating.
[03:21]Made it clear suddenly. 
[03:28]The feeling that I can't go on 
[03:35]is light years away.
