[00:33]Now I'm off to see the wizard
[00:35]He who hold the key
[00:36]To give me answers to the questions I need
[00:38]He told me that I wasn't happy about the way of my world
[00:41]And I had to tend to say I agree

[00:44]Then he told me that you got to change your state of mind
[00:47]You got to start at the beginning leave all behind
[00:50]Take a new direction
[00:52]Believe in your decision
[00:53]And take it to the top and no one's gonna stop me

[03:24][03:01][01:52][00:56]*I feel a chill when it rain rain rains
[03:04][01:54][00:58]And I just won't let it get to me
[03:29][03:07][01:57][01:01]I shake me head and go my my my
[03:09][01:59][01:04]See my face and know what I mean
[03:35][03:12][02:03][01:07]Make some sense out of this whole mess
[03:15][02:05][01:09]And I couldn't careless if it kills me
[03:40][03:18][02:08][01:12]Give me room to express myself
[03:21][02:11][01:15]Just as long as I believe in me

[01:29]A pocket full of wishes and a world of dreams
[01:32]And I never seem to be complete
[01:34]I thought a woman could be all the angles for me
[01:37]But it turn out to be all deceit
[01:39]And you'll never never know for sure
[01:43]If people ever mean what they say
[01:46]When taking the chances you just have to realize
[01:49]Life is a gamble if you're doing it in your way

Repeat *

[02:38]Now I got a hold of my life and I found a real love
[02:41]And I'm counting all the blessings I've got
[02:44]All my dreams put into motion
[02:46]And I'm about to take flight
[02:47]Disregarding all the negative thoughts
[02:50]Oh I'm feeling kinda good about my future thank
[02:53]Now I'm just beginning to see
[02:56]I took a new direction
[02:57]Spin in to perfection
