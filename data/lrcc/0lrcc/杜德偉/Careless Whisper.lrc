[00:01]Careless Whisper

[00:04]杜德偉

[00:25]I feel so unsure
[00:31]As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
[00:38]As the music dies, Something in your eyes,
[00:44]Calls to mind a silver screen And all it's sad good-bye
[00:50]I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[00:57]Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
[01:02]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[01:06]And waste the chance that I've been given
[01:09]So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
[01:28]Time can never mend The careless whisper of a good friend
[01:40]To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
[01:46]There's no comfort in the truth Pain is all you'll find
[03:08][01:53]I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm
[03:15][01:59]Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
[03:20][02:05]I should have known better than to cheat a friend
[03:24][02:08]And waste the chance that I've been given
[03:27][02:12]So I'm never gonna dance again The way I dance with you
[02:43]Tonight the music seem so loud
[02:46]I wish that we could lose this crowd Maybe it's better this way
[02:52]We hurt each other with the things we want to say
[02:55]We could have been so good together
[02:58]We could have lived this dance forever
[03:02]But now who's gonna dance with me, Please stay
[03:46]Now that you're gone now that you're gone
[04:01]Was what i did so wrong, so wrong
[04:07]That you have to leave me along
