[00:18]Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
[00:25]Hand in hand you and I
[00:30]Let's cherish every moment we have been given
[00:35]The time is passing by
[00:40]I often pray before I lay down by your side
[00:50]If you receive your calling before I awake
[00:55]Could I make it through the night

[04:03][03:22][02:02][01:00]*cherish the love we have
[04:07][03:26][02:05][01:05]We should cherish the life we live
[04:13][03:32][02:10][01:11]Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
[03:42][02:22]Cherish the love we have
[03:47][02:26]For as long as we both shall live
[03:53][02:31]Cherish the love, cherish the life,
[03:58][02:37]Cherish the love*

[01:21]The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
[01:26]But love will stand the test of time
[01:31]The next life that we live in, remains to be seen
[01:36]Will you be by my side
[01:41]I often pray before I lay down by your side
[01:51]And if you receive your calling before I awake
[01:56]Could I make it through the night
