[00:35]Used to be on my own
[00:38]Used to cry all alone
[00:42]Used to sit by the phone
[00:45]Waiting for love

[00:50]Dancing all by myself
[00:54]Wishing there's someone else
[00:57]I can share all my love
[01:00]Baby it's you

[03:14][02:10][01:05]*Dance with me
[03:17][02:14][01:09]Let's take it slow
[03:22][02:18][01:14]Wait and see
[03:25][02:21][01:18]Please don't go
[03:30][02:26][01:22]Dance with me
[03:34][02:29][01:25]Now we are alone
[03:38][02:34][01:30]Fantasy
[03:41][02:37][01:33]Let's follow

[01:37]Every smile that you made
[01:41]Every look that you gave
[01:46]Girl I know that is you
[01:49]I've been dreaming of
