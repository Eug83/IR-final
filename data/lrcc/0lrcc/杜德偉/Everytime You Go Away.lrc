[00:24]Hey if we can solve any problems
[00:31]Why do we lose so many tears
[00:37]Oh I saw you go again
[00:43]When the leading man appears
[00:49]Always the same thing
[00:55]Can't you see we've got
[00:57]Everything going on and on and on

[03:57][03:33][03:10][02:11][01:01]Everytime you go away
[04:02][03:38][03:15][02:17][01:07]You take a piece of me with you
[04:08][03:45][03:21][02:23][01:13]Everytime you go away
[03:50][03:27][02:28][01:18]You take a piece of me with you

[01:36]Go on and go free
[01:42]Maybe you are too close to see
[01:48]I can feel your body move
[01:53]Doesn't mean that much to me
[02:58][01:59]I can't go on singing the same theme
[03:03][02:05]Cause (baby) can't you see We've got
[03:06][02:07]Everything baby even though you know
