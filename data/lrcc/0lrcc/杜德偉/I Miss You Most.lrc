[00:01]I Miss You Most 

[00:04]杜德偉 
  

[00:25]It's almost time
[00:27]For me to do my show
[00:31]You're always there
[00:35]There on the very first row
[00:39]But things have changed
[00:43]And so the story goes
[00:47]And I don't know where you are
[00:51]And my spirits are so low 

[00:55]But I'm a pro
[00:58]I know that I must perform
[01:02]I'll do my best
[01:05]To make sure that show goes on
[01:10]So I'll get by
[01:15]So pass the microphone
[01:18]But deep inside I know
[01:22]That there'll be no applause at home

[03:10][02:40][01:27]And I'll miss you most
[03:14][02:43][01:30]When I'm singing
[03:19][02:48][01:33]When I hit the last note
[03:22][02:51][01:37]I'll be calling out your name
[03:26][02:55][01:42]I'll miss you most
[03:30][02:59][01:46]When I'm singing
[03:34][03:03][01:48]And the final curtain call I'll feel the pain

[02:09]Here I am
[02:12]Alone in my dressing room
[02:16]Wondering how I'll get the strength to croon
[02:24]And everywhere are pictures of me for you
[02:32]But these melodies of love has turned into songs of blue
