[00:02]I Miss You

[00:04]§ù¼w°¶

[00:26]Though I heard your voice yesterday
[00:33]Then I turned around to say, that I loved you, then I realize
[00:42]That it was just my mind playing tricks on me
[00:51]It seems colder lately at night
[00:58]And I try to sleep with the lights on
[01:03]Everytime the phone rings, I pray to God it's you
[01:10]I just can't believe, that we're through
[01:18]I miss you, (I miss you)
[01:24]There's no other way to say it (and I )
[01:29]And I can't deny it I miss you, (I miss you)
[01:36]It's so easy to see I miss you and me
[01:57]Is it done and over this time
[02:03]Have we really changed our minds
[02:07]'Bout each other's love
[02:11]all the feelings that we used to share
[02:15]I refuse to believe that you don't care
[02:22]I miss you, (I miss you)
[02:28]There's no other way to say it (and I )
[02:33]And I can't deny it I miss you, (I miss you)
[02:41]It's so easy to see
[02:45]I've got to gather my senses together
[02:55]I've been through worse kinds of weather
[03:01]If it's over now (over now), be strong (be strong)
[03:05]I can't believe that you're gone
[03:13]I've got to carry on but I miss you, (I miss you)
[03:21]It's driving me crazy I don't want to live without you
[03:28]I miss you, (I miss you) It's so easy to see
[03:37]I miss you and me
