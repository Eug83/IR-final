[00:08]Just another night on the town
[00:13]Looking for some swinging old sound
[00:18]Mandarina Lady is the only club that I found
[00:26]People in the mood everywhere
[00:33]Magic I can feel in the air
[00:37]See if I can find some love for me at all

[00:47]Walk some lady
[00:49]Dress in a long silky gown
[00:55]She's something special
[00:58]Couldn't be from this side of town

[01:04]She's assigned man wants to see
[01:10]To my surprise she is looking at me
[01:14]Mandarina lady sweeps me off the ground

[01:30]I'll take you the way out

[01:52]Closer and closer we dance
[01:56]But no conversation no chance
[02:01]Mandarina lady can we talk at all
[02:09]Oh...can I hold you closer
[02:13]Tell you things that I like to say
[02:17]Well...she spoken in a whisper
[02:22]And taught me sing in this way

[02:28]我愛你means I love you 
[02:34]別問我means don't ask me why
