[00:02]No One Else Comes Close 


[00:04]§ù¼w°¶ 
  

[00:18]When we turn out the lights
[00:22]The two of us alone together
[00:27]Something just not right
[00:31]But girl you know that I'd never
[00:36]ever let another's touch come between the two of us
[00:44]Cause no one else could never take your place

[02:51][02:15][00:52]No one else comes close to you
[02:55][02:19][00:57]No one makes me feel the way you do
[02:59][02:24][01:01]You're so special girl to me
[03:03][02:28][01:05]And you'll always be eternally
[03:08][02:33][01:10]Every time I hold you near
[03:12][02:37][01:14]You always say the words I love to hear
[03:17][02:42][01:18]Girl with just a touch you can do so much
[03:35][01:23]No one else come close

[01:41]And when I wake up to
[01:45]The touch of your head on my shoulder
[01:50]You're my dream come true
[01:55]Oh girl you know I'll always treasure
[01:59]Every kiss everyday love you girl in every way
[02:07]And I always will cause in my eyes
