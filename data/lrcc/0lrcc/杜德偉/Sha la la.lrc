[00:42]I thought I had no chance
[00:44]Thought I never find romance
[00:47]There's an empty space still left in my heart
[00:51]Then you came alone
[00:54]Giving lyrics to my song
[00:57]I'll never be alone in the night
[01:01]Girl as long as you're there holding me tight
[01:06]I'm so involved with you
[01:09]My heart is in your hand
[01:14]So now you understand

[03:40][03:20][01:18][00:19]Sha la la
[03:45][03:25][01:22][00:27]You are the only one I dream of
[03:50][03:30][01:27][00:32]Sha la la
[03:55][03:35][01:32][00:37]You are the one that makes me feel love

[01:37]I know it's a new day
[01:39]Cause I've never felt this way
[01:42]You can see it by the smile on my face
[01:47]There's no reason why
[01:49]I can't keep you satisfied
[01:52]You look at me and I look at you
[01:56]I know automatically what to do
[02:01]Girl just close your eyes and I'll take you there
[02:08]Just throw away your cares

[02:13]Sha la la
[02:17]You are the only one I dream of
[02:22]Sha la la
[02:27]You are the one that makes me feel love
