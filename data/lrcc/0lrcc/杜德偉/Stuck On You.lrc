[00:18]I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
[00:22]That I just can't lose guess I'm on my way
[00:29]Needed a friend
[00:33]And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
[00:38]Guess I'm on my way I'm mighty glad you stayed
[00:59]I'm stuck on you
[01:02]Been a fool too long I guess it's time for me to come on home
[01:08]Guess I'm on my way So hard to see
[01:16]That a woman like you would wait around for a man like me
[01:22]Guess I'm on my way I'm mighty glad you stayed
[01:43]Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow
[01:50]And I know just where I'm going
[01:57]I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away
[02:04]'Cause this time little darlin' I'm coming home to stay
[02:18]I'm stuck on you

[02:36]And the way I feel now I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
