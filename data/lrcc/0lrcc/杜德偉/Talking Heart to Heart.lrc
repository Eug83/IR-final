[00:40]Every night every day
[00:44]I've be waiting for your love to come and stay
[00:51]Now I found you on my way
[00:56]Catch my breath close my eyes
[01:00]I always imagine that you are by my side
[01:07]Such feeling of desire

[02:37][01:13]I wanna bring you closer
[02:40][01:15]Watch you every single step
[02:44][01:18]Romance between two lovers is what I am trying to get

[03:52][02:53][01:31]We are talking heart to heart
[03:56][02:58][01:34]See the magic moment start
[04:00][03:03][01:39]Hold you honestly we never be apart
[04:08][03:11][01:47]We are searching for a sign
[04:12][03:15][01:50]Let the passion be alive
[04:17][03:19][01:55]And I promise you
[04:20][03:22][01:58]You don't have to ask me why

[02:09]We belong together
[02:12]No one can deny
[02:15]Cause your body reads my mind
[02:20]Just call me, I'll be there
[02:24]Open up your senses and throw away your cares
[02:31]There is a lifetime for us to share
