[00:03]杜德偉 
  

[00:37]Whenever I get lonely
[00:41]I have a vision of you
[00:44]You made me feel so warm and cozy
[00:48]I don't know what to do
[00:51]So I call you every morning
[00:55]Just to hear you when you wake up
[00:59]And hope that we together be
[01:03]For all eternity

[01:07]Let me take you somewhere
[01:10]Far from all your troubles
[01:14]So I can hug you kiss you comfort you
[01:17]And hold you through night
[01:21]We can start a new beginning
[01:25]One that never has an ending
[01:29]Just the two
[01:31]Me and you
[01:33]Forever in a life

[04:03][02:57][01:37]*Baby tell me
[04:07][03:00][01:40]What I have to do to keep you in my life
[04:15][03:06][01:47]I'll do it all for you

[04:48][04:18][03:11][01:52]#Baby tell me
[04:52][04:22][03:14][01:56]What's a man to do when loving you feels right
[04:59][04:30][03:23][02:04]Tell me what we're gonna do tonight

[04:34]Tell me
[04:37]What I have to do to keep you in my life
[04:45]I'll do it all for you

[02:22]Lately I've been feeling
[02:25]A sadness deep inside me
[02:29]But when I hold your body next to me
[02:33]The pain just goes away
[02:36]Cause the love we share between us
[02:40]Is the key to all our happiness
[02:44]Without a flaw, Spring or fall
[02:48]I'll love you through its all

Repeat *# 

[03:33]When I'm feeling cold and lonely
[03:40]And you're feeling quite the same
[03:48]Girl I wanna hold you close to my heart
[03:56]Nothing can tear us apart
[04:00]Cause I'll be with you right there from the start

Repeat *#
