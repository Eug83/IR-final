[00:24]Baby we can talk all night
[00:30]But that ain't getting us nowhere
[00:38]I told you everything I possibly can
[00:44]There's nothing left inside of here
[00:49]And maybe you can cry all night
[00:55]But that'll never change the way that I feel
[01:03]The snow is really piling up outside
[01:09]I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
[01:16]I poured it on and I poured it out
[01:22]I tried to show you just how much I care
[01:29]I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
[01:34]But you've been cold to me so long
[01:40]I'm crying icicles instead of tears
[01:47]And all I can do is keep on telling you
[01:53]I want you, I need you
[01:59]But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
[02:06]Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad, cause two)
[02:13]Cause two out of three ain't bad
[02:19]Now don't be sad, Cause two out of three ain't bad
[02:41]You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
[02:47]You'll never drill for oil on a city street
[02:53]I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
[02:59]But there ain't no coupe de ville hiding
[03:04]At the bottom of a cracker jack box
[03:11]I can't lie I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
[03:22]No matter how I try
[03:25]I'll never be able to give you something
[03:31]Something that I just haven't got
[03:38]There's only one girl that I will ever love
[03:43]And that was so many years ago
[03:48]And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
[03:56]She never loved me back, ooh I know
[04:02]I remember how she left me on a stormy night
[04:09]Oh she kissed me and got out of our bed
[04:15]And though I pleaded
[04:17]And I begged her not to walk out that door
[04:22]She packed her bags and turned right away
[04:28]And she kept on telling me, I want you, I need you
[04:43]But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
[04:50]Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad, cause two)
[04:57]Cause two out of three ain't bad
[05:02]Now don't be sad, Cause two out of three ain't bad
