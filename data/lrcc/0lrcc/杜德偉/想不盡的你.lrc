[00:10]原唱：杜德偉
[00:18]詞、曲：小蟲
[00:26][02:09]是誰讓我將眼淚流在雨中
[00:33][02:16]是誰讓我將希望變成落空
[00:39][02:22]你就這樣的來就這樣的走
[00:45][02:28]你從不回頭
[00:48][02:31]一點希望也不留給我

[00:52][02:35]你知道 我有多麼痛苦
[00:57][02:40]你該明瞭  你一定都明瞭
[01:05][02:47]你知道我有多麼想你
[01:11][02:53]你該明瞭  或許你沒想到

[01:17][03:00]我仍然留你在心上  就算是離開你
[01:23][03:06]留戀失去的回憶  我現在好想你
[01:30][03:12]我依然默默愛著你  就算是離開你
[01:36][03:19]期待能在見到你  我真的好想你
[01:43][03:26]我好想你
