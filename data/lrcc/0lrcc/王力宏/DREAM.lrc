[00:29]I turn on the stereo.the groove is nice and slow
[00:35]If only she was here to dance along
[00:41]I write her letters every single day
[00:47]There's only so much words can say
[00:53]We'll be together soon. I'm dancin' in my roon
[00:59]Imagining you're not so far away
[01:04]And I dream, again
[01:08]You're right by my side
[01:11]You're back in my arms again
[01:14]A feeling so sublime
