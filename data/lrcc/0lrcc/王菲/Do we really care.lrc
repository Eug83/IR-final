[00:43]I saw a picture of a small girl ¡@
[00:50]Crying and living in a lost world ¡@
[00:57]The men fight for dear God ¡@
[01:01]She don't care ¡@
[01:05]cause there ain't nothing left to share ¡@
[01:12]I'd watched T.V. about a sick girl ¡@
[01:19]She was only nine but she'll be gone soon ¡@
[01:26]When and where she's going God will know ¡@
[01:33]She doesn't want the sun to go¡@   
[03:06][01:40]Don't you know that we care ¡@
[03:14][01:47]Keep the faith and hope is here ¡@
[03:21][01:54]Deep in my heart I ask myself ¡@
[03:26][02:00]Do we really really care   ¡@
[02:09]I read  the paper of a coloured boy ¡@
[02:16]He was starving so we're the lone vultures
[02:23]Why so full of sorrow no tomorrow ¡@
[02:29]There's no rainbow ¡@
[02:31]Will he ever know? ¡@
[03:35]Don't you know that we pray ¡@
[03:42]For you to see the light of day ¡@
[03:49]For you to bring back the look of love ¡@
[03:55]Words of wisdom ¡@
[03:58]Is it enough
