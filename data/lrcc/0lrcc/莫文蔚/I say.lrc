[00:00]I say
[00:23]Pretty Baby Oh Pretty Baby
[00:27]What's Come Over?You look weary today.
[00:31]Kinka weary Like a child at play
[00:34]I see no reason for regrets or dismay
[00:40]What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
[00:47]What I do I do with total passion
[00:51]Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
[00:55]Lucky lady Oh lucky lady
[00:58]I have a feeling of success on the way
[01:02]Never easy On a rainy day
[01:06]I take no comfort in the games that you play
[01:11]What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
[01:19]What I do I do with total passion
[01:23]Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
[01:27]I say I'll play I'll lay
[01:32]down my rules before you turn away
[01:34]and I swear I dare To share
[01:39]all my love if only you would do as I say
[01:40](music)
[01:51]Lovely lady Oh lovely lady
[01:54]What is the secret to success all the way
[01:58]A little beauty Goes a long way
[02:02]It conjures up the little trick that I play
[02:07]What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fashion
[02:15]What I do I do with total passion
[02:18]Listen to my cries Look into my eyes
[02:22]I say I'll play I'll lay
[02:27]down my rules before you turn away
[02:30]and I swear I dare To share
[02:35]all my love if only you would do as I say
[02:52](music)
[03:04]I say I'll play I'll lay
[03:09]down my rules before you turn away
[03:11]and I swear I dare To share
[03:17]all my love if only you would do as I say
[03:20]I say I'll play I'll lay
[03:23]down my rules before you turn away
[03:27]and I swear I dare To share
[03:32]all my love if only you would do as I say
[03:36]
