[00:01]Lies the seed that with the sun's love 
[00:09]In the spring 
[00:12]Becomes the rose 
[00:42]Some say love
[00:45]It is a river that drowns the tender reed 
[00:54]Some say love
[00:56]It is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed 
[01:05]Some say love
[01:08]It is a hunger an endless aching need 
[01:17]I say love
[01:20]It is a flower and you it's only seed 
[01:55]It's the heart
[01:58]Afraid of breaking that never learns to dance 
[02:07]It's the dream
[02:09]Afraid of walking that never takes the chance 
[02:18]It's the one
[02:21]who won't be taken who can't seem to give 
[02:30]And the soul
[02:33]Afraid of dying that never learns to live 
[03:05]When the night has been too lonely 
[03:11]And the road has been too long 
[03:17]And you think
[03:19]That love is only for the lucky and the strong 
[03:28]Just remember
[03:31]In the winter for beneath the bitter snow 
[03:52][03:40]Lies the seed that with the sun's love 
[03:58][03:46]in the spring becomes the rose 
[02:41]¡]Rap¡^ 
[02:43]Life is a gift and you gotta learn to live
[02:46]It if you believe in love 
[02:47]You gotta learn to give it 
[02:48]Tryin' to find someone who's kind is hard to do 
[02:51]You want the love but you really don't know what to do 
[02:54]You're just afraid of someone breaking your heart 
[02:57]You never learned to live you gave up from the start 
[03:00]You felt the pain but it made you strong 
[03:03]So remember no matter what you will go on
