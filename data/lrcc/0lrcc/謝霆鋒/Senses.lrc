[02:04][00:17]I go bring When I look straight into the sun
[02:10][00:23]I go deaf when I hear thunders on the run
[02:15][00:29]But when I sse you sleeping here beside me.
[02:19][00:32]Life's just begun
[02:21][00:35]I can tell it to the whole world.
[02:24][00:37]You're the one I see your shadow cast on the wall 
[02:30][00:43]When the sun shines
[02:32][00:45]I hear you calling through the window
[02:36][00:49]when it rains
[02:38][00:51]I tend to tremble when I start to think of 
[02:42][00:55]just you andl I don't know why. 
[02:47][01:00]There's no reply
[03:02][01:06]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:07][01:12]I'm shivering when I'm standing alone. 
[03:13][01:18]A stom is torming deep inside me.
[03:19][01:24]A hurricane has got a life of it's own. 
[03:24][01:29]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:31][01:35]Without you I'm just falling apart.
[03:36][01:41]The snow is freezing all my senses,
[03:42][01:47]When hail falls down,
[03:45][01:49]Then it's already too late for heartbreak!
