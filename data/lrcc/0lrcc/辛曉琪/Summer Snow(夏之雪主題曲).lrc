[00:25.06]It's summer snow in the deep blue sea
[00:37.94]I try to touch but it fades away
[00:50.45]It must be a dream
[00:56.65]I will never get
[01:02.80]Just like my love that's crying for you
[01:16.74]If there were something
[01:22.41]not to change forever
[01:29.20]We could feel it deep,
[01:35.35]deep in our heart
[01:42.45]Today was over with a million tears
[01:55.09]Still everyone has a wish to live
[02:59.61]Oh I do believe everlasting love
[03:12.00]And destiny to meet you again
[03:25.27]I feel a pain
[03:31.38]I can hardly stand
[03:38.09]All I can do is loving you
[03:51.64]It's summer snow in the deep blue sea
[04:03.29]I try to touch but it fades away
[04:16.97]It must be a dream
[04:23.08]Iwill never get
[04:29.50]Just like my love that's crying for you
[04:42.84]Just like my love that's crying for you
