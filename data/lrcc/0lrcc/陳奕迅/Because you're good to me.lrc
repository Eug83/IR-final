[00:01.07]陳奕迅：Because you're good to me
[03:17.92][03:00.58][02:43.44]Because you're good to me, babe, I know.
[02:02.83][01:02.96][00:00.73]Because you're good to me, babe, I know.
[03:20.76][03:03.71][02:46.34]That you're up to something and I don't like it.
[02:05.92][01:05.91][00:03.81]That you're up to something and I don't like it.
[03:26.27][03:09.02][02:51.82]Because you're good to me, babe, I know.
[02:11.31][01:11.32][00:09.26]Because you're good to me, babe, I know.
[03:29.38][03:12.14][02:54.87][02:14.45][01:14.51][00:12.45]You're no good. 
[03:31.57][03:14.41][02:57.19][02:16.68][01:16.66][00:14.68]It's no good to be in love with you again.
[00:28.70]當時分手之後，
[00:30.75]多麼心痛。
[00:32.89]你卻還能夠說，
[00:35.07]都是我的錯。
[00:37.30]之後你打電話，
[00:39.32]說你很寂寞，
[00:41.46]一直想念我，
[00:43.30]是否還能夠做朋友。
[01:45.43][00:45.50]No baby, no baby, 請你別再靠近我。
[01:49.63][00:49.68]No baby, no baby, 你沒那麼的保守。
[01:53.90][00:53.93]No baby, no baby, 別到現在才來對我說，
[01:58.87][00:59.10]你後悔了。
[02:01.08][01:01.37]And ask me for more。
[01:28.73]昨晚跟好朋友，
[01:30.85]開個party，
[01:33.21]怎麼都沒想到，
[01:35.21]會再見到你。
[01:37.49]你的甜言蜜語，
[01:39.48]讓我佩服到底。
[01:41.64]誰在誰懷裡，
[01:43.31]愛誰不過是個騙局。
