Chorus:
[00:00.00][03:32.94][03:00.46][02:19.35][01:13.87]Baby, baby, to me you're everything
[03:38.14][03:05.56][02:24.29][01:18.88][00:05.01]It's just the love and joy that you bring
[03:42.18][03:09.53][02:28.45][01:23.09][00:09.59]No one can take the place I've given you
[03:47.43][03:14.55][02:33.57][01:28.25][00:14.40]Ooh, girl, you're like an angel in disguise
[03:54.40][03:21.95][02:40.43][01:35.09][00:21.72]You are the dream that never will die
[03:58.48][03:25.75][02:44.92][01:39.15][00:25.49]'Cause, baby, to me you're everything
[03:31.24][00:30.97](Ooh girl)
[04:03.09][02:49.49][01:44.06][00:38.47]You're my everything, oh yeah

[00:41.91]I've been thinking 'bout you lately
[00:44.36](Show me, show me love)
[00:45.65]And it just troubles my mind
[00:47.99](Got my mind you)
[00:49.71]'Cause the things you said
[00:51.82]Right before you walked away
[00:54.77]It brought so much pain (Girl)
[00:58.20]I've been walking in these four walls
[01:00.86](Thinkin' about your love)
[01:02.15]Trying to find my way out
[01:04.37](Trying to find a way)
[01:06.01]I got a picture of you
[01:08.67]Deep inside my heart
[01:12.24]And you know

[01:47.41]There is nothing like the real thing
[01:49.61](Show me, show me love)
[01:51.11]And girl I'll always be true
[01:53.23](Always true to you)
[01:55.03]I've got no time to waste
[01:57.24]I know there is no better place
[02:00.45]Than right here with you
[02:03.44]And yeah, you've got that thing
[02:06.32]And I want it (And I want it)
[02:08.58]And I know it by now (ooh, ooh)
[02:11.97]There's nothing I ain't gonna do to you (ooh, ooh)




[04:05.76]Baby!!!
