[00:01.00]Singing for the lonely
[00:05.63]You're not the only ones who feel this
[00:11.68]So scared of what we're doing
[00:16.84]All the time
[00:22.98]Here comes wasted head-space
[00:27.99]Paranoia
[00:30.62]Anger, misplaced feelings
[00:36.01]Leave me nowhere
[00:38.79]All the time
[00:40.99]
[00:45.05]I don't wake up early every morning
[00:50.47]'Cause the more I sleep the less I have to say
[00:55.95]Scared of you always thinking that I'm boring
[01:00.91]Stop me yawning my life away
[01:05.42]
[01:06.99]Tender young confusion
[01:11.59]Send black mariah for blue delusions
[01:17.94]Lays heavy oh so heavy
[01:22.84]On my mind
[01:25.15]
[01:29.11]I'm so sick of people's expectations
[01:34.46]Leaves me tired all the time
[01:39.92]If your home's full of useless aggravation
[01:45.26]Then don't bring it to mine
[01:51.10]
[02:13.14]I seem to spend my life
[02:15.18]Just waiting for the chorus
[02:18.44]'Cause the verse is never nearly
[02:20.45]Good enough
[02:23.15]
[02:24.02]The hooligan half of me
[02:25.93]That steals from Woolworths
[02:28.99]While the other lives for love
[02:33.75]
[02:35.08]I'm so sick of people's expectations
[02:40.56]Leaves me tired all the time
[02:45.62]If your home's full of worthless aggravation
[02:51.32]Then don't bring it to mine
[02:56.33]
[02:57.13]Singing for the lonely
[03:01.73]We're not the only ones who feel this
[03:07.92]So scared of what I'm doing
[03:12.93]All the time
[03:15.34]
[03:19.11]Singing for the Lonely
[03:23.85]We're not the only ones who feel this
[03:30.16]Scared of what we're doing
[03:34.99]All the time
[03:37.67]
[03:41.38]Singing For The Lonely
[03:43.45][R Williams and G Chambers]
