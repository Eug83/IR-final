[03:37.87][03:02.00][01:36.98][00:05.49]
[00:22.95]such a felling's soming over me
[00:28.15]there is wonder in most everything i see
[00:33.30]not a cloud in the sky
[00:36.02]got the sun in my eyes
[00:38.50]and i won't be surprised if it's a dream
[00:44.87]everything i want the world to be
[00:50.17]is now coming true especially for me
[00:55.16]and the reason is clear
[00:58.16]it's because you are here
[01:00.85]you're the bearest thing to heaven that i've seen
[01:06.95]i'm on the top of the world looking
[01:10.36]down on creation and the only explanation i can find
[01:17.02]is the love that i've found ever since you've been
[01:23.48]around your lover's put me on the top of the world
[01:28.89]on the top of the world
[01:38.60]something in the wind has learned my name
[01:43.62]and it's telling me that things are not the same
[01:49.08]in the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
[01:54.12]there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me
[02:00.66]there is only one wish on my mind
[02:05.67]when this day is through i hope that i will find
[02:10.48]that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
[02:16.50]all i need will be mine if you are here
[02:22.18]i'm on the top of the world looking
[02:25.28]down on creation and the only explanation i can
[02:32.93]is the love that i've been around your love's
[02:38.81]put me on the top of the world
[03:05.47][02:44.74]on the top of the world
