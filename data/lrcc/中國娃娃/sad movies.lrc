[00:02.30]Sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry

[00:16.08]He said he had to work so I went to the show alone
[00:23.38]They turned down the lights and turned the projector on
[00:32.91]And just as the news of the world started to begin
[00:40.68]I saw my darlin』and my best friend walk in

[00:50.41]Though I was sittin』 there they didn』t see
[00:59.18]And so they sat right down in front of me
[01:07.95]When he kissed her lips I almost died
[01:15.38]And in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cry.

[01:23.87]Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
[01:34.64]Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry

[01:46.76]And so I got up and slowly walked on home
[01:55.56]And mama saw the tears and said 「what』s wrong?」
[02:04.21]And so to keep from telling her a lie
[02:11.41]I just said 「sa-a-a-d movies make me cry」

[02:45.52]Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry
[03:03.66]Oh-oh-oh sa-a-a-d movies always make me cry

[03:14.32]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[03:36.46]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sa-a-a-d movies make me cry-i-i
