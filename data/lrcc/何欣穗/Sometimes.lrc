[00:04.85][00:05.74]                                   Sometimes
[00:10.17]I'd like to be alone
[00:15.29]with no one else to touch me
[00:19.50]or reach me except myself
[03:42.92][03:08.74][01:31.85][01:05.11][00:24.74]
[00:27.74]Sometimes
[00:32.61]I'd like to be your friend
[00:37.32]I hope you'll understand that
[00:41.20]I do love you but I can't
[00:50.37]We don't even shake hands We don't act like we care
[00:56.28]We've got nothing left to say
[01:01.58]Because we're here in Taipei
[01:07.41]So our kisses live only in the dark
[01:12.41]and our love dies when the morning comes
[01:18.61]So our kisses live only in the dark
[01:23.41]and our love dies when the morning comes
[01:34.46]That's why sometimes I'd like to be alone
[01:44.73]With no one else to touch me or reach me except myself
[01:57.16]Sometimes I wish I could simply fly away with you of course if you want to
[02:09.90]Sometimes I wish I could hug you like a friend
[02:13.90]but no of course we dare not to
[02:20.24]Sometimes I wish I could simply fly away with you of course if you want to
[02:31.25]Sometimes I wish I could hug you like a friend
[02:36.05]but no of course we dare not to
[02:42.80]We don't even shake hands We don't act like we care
[02:47.65]We've got nothing left to say
[02:52.92]We don't even shake hands We don't act like we care
[02:58.76]We've got nothing left to say
[03:04.41]Because we're here in Taipei
[03:32.75][03:22.02][03:10.35]So our kisses live only in the dark
[03:37.28][03:26.52][03:15.17]and our love dies when the morning comes
