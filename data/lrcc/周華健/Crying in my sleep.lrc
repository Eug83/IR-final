[00:00.00]周華健    << Crying in my sleep >>
[00:26.00]詞：      曲：
[00:27.00]
[00:28.00]I took a walk around the yard
[00:32.00]I dug the flowers till it got too hard
[00:36.00]Smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
[00:45.00]Then I, I went down, down to Lucy's old cafe
[00:52.00]I put a half a case away
[00:56.00]Took a sleeping pill and
[00:58.00]I tried to watch TV
[01:01.00]But you know baby, the leading lady
[01:04.00]Looked too much like you for the likes of me
[02:46.00][01:08.00]And I woke up crying in my sleep
[02:53.00][01:15.00]I was talking to your pillow
[03:01.00][01:23.00]And I reached out to touch your hand
[03:08.00][01:30.00]I knocked the phone off the night stand
[03:12.00][01:34.00]And the operator said, " Can I help you please？"
[03:19.00][01:41.00]And I said " No thanks baby,
[03:21.00][01:43.00]tonight there ain't no help for me."
[03:39.00][03:32.00][01:54.00][03:24.00][01:47.00]You see I just had a bad dream
[03:36.00][03:29.00][01:51.00]That's all that's wrong with me
[02:06.00]Went out to loosen up the car
[02:10.00]Somehow I wound up at the Rainbow Bar
[02:14.00]I had a scotch and soda on the run
[02:21.00]But didn't get too far
[02:23.00]Then I, I ran down, down some friends
[02:28.00]I used to know
[02:31.00]I dragged them out to see the show
[02:34.00]I ran myself a bath and
[02:36.00]I tried to read your book
[02:39.00]But you know baby,this time it just didn't seem
[02:43.00]Worth all the time it look
[01:58.00]（ MUSIC )
