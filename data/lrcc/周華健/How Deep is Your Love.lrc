[00:17.53]I know your eyes in the morning sun
[00:21.61]I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
[02:16.87][00:26.55]And the moment that you wonder far from me
[02:20.56][00:30.82]I wanna feel you in my arms again
[02:25.30][00:35.55]Then you come to me on a summer breeze
[02:29.89][00:40.14]Keep me warm in your love
[02:32.34][00:42.39]Then you softly leave
[02:34.75][00:44.80]And it's me you need to show
[03:09.34][02:38.36][00:48.68]How deep is your love
[03:13.86][02:44.16][01:49.84][00:54.56]I really mean to learn
[03:17.19][02:47.61][01:52.99][00:57.70]Cause we're living in a world of fools
[03:21.67][02:52.16][01:57.46][01:02.36]Breaking us down
[03:24.31][02:55.08][02:00.06][01:05.04]When they all should let us be
[03:28.82][02:59.23][02:04.65][01:09.56]We belong to you and me
[03:33.71][02:08.68]
[01:13.61]I believe in you
[01:16.76]You know the door to my very soul
[01:20.84]You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
[01:26.05]You're my saviour when I fall
[01:30.36]And you may not think I care of you
[01:34.79]When you know down inside that I really do
[01:39.34]And its me you need to show
[01:43.46]How deep is your love
