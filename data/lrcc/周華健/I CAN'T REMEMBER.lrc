[00:00.00]周華健    << I CAN'T REMEMBER >>
[00:12.00]詞：     曲：
[00:13.00]
[00:20.00]Everday when I think I see her 
[00:23.00]I want to meet her
[00:25.00]But I trun the other way
[00:27.00]And all the time I wanna say something to her 
[00:30.00]saysomething to her
[00:36.00][00:32.00]but I wait another day
[00:54.00][00:34.00]hey.....
[00:40.00]And everday I try hard not to stare
[00:43.00]not that she'd care
[00:45.00]But I'm too shy to act on a care
[00:47.00]And if find that she can't be mine
[00:50.00]she's not my kind
[00:52.00]Then I would be wasting my time
[00:56.00]I would be wasting my time
[01:53.00][01:00.00]They all tell me just to speak my mind
[01:56.00][01:03.00]And let my mouth unwind to act real gental and kind
[02:02.00][01:09.00]I don't think I'm ready yet to call her her mind
[02:06.00][01:12.00]I don't think it's time
[02:07.00][01:14.00]And it's easier said then done
[02:46.00][02:11.00][01:18.00]And No I can't remember
[02:47.00][02:13.00][01:20.00]And No I can't remember
[02:49.00][02:15.00][01:21.00]And No I can't remember
[02:51.00][02:16.00][01:23.00]No I can't remember 
[02:53.00][02:18.00][01:25.00]my life
[02:54.00][02:19.00][01:26.00]And everday I've present go give her
[02:57.00][02:22.00][01:29.00]present to give her
[02:59.00][02:24.00][01:31.00]But I put the present away
[03:01.00][02:26.00][01:33.00]And everday when I think I miss her
[03:04.00][02:29.00][01:36.00]I want to kiss her
[03:06.00][02:32.00][01:38.00]But I keep my distance and wait
[03:08.00][02:34.00][01:40.00]Until a day when I've got something to say
[03:14.00][02:39.00][01:46.00]That will be my happies day
[03:17.00][02:42.00][01:49.00]That will be my happies day
[03:21.00]
[03:22.00]
