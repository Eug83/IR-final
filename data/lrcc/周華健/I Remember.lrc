[00:14.50]編譯：執著
[00:21.50]
[00:29.09](EMIL) There were times when i did not know what to do
[00:35.92]That's when you said that you could show me
[00:41.80](MANDY) Now i find my life has changed because of you
[00:48.89]I knew it would when you said hold me

[03:09.39][02:44.22][01:46.06][00:55.01](together) I can feel it rising with the sun
[03:16.08][02:50.27][01:52.90][01:01.51]Shining pure just like the morning light
[03:22.46][02:57.01][01:59.24][01:08.06]I 'm so very sure that you're the one for me

[03:36.02][03:28.76][03:03.31][02:05.79][01:14.92](EMIL) Baby your love has set me free
[01:19.74](MANDY) Though the time that's past has not been much at all
[01:27.40]I feel like i've known you since forever
[01:33.06](EMIL) I remember well the very day you called
[01:40.19]so easy we fell in love together

[02:11.64](MANDY) I never thought that love could be like this
[02:18.46](EMIL) It took me beyond my expectations
[02:24.15](MANDY) It's never the same when i feel your kiss
[02:31.44](EMIL) I want to thank you, but, can't find the words
[02:38.32]Baby your love has set me free
