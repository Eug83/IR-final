[00:17.78]I remember all my life.
[00:22.10]Raining down as cold as ice.
[00:26.02]Shadows of a man
[00:28.21]a face through a window.
[00:30.37]Crying in the night,
[00:32.45]the night goes into the morning.Just another day,
[00:38.90]happy people pass my way.
[00:43.25]Looking in their eyes, I see a memory.
[00:47.39]I never realized how happy you made me.
[00:51.32]Oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking.
[00:57.50]But I sent you away.
[00:59.48]Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking.
[01:06.11]And I need you today. Oh Mandy.
[01:17.49]I'm standing on the edge of time.
[01:21.64]I've walked away when love was mine.
[01:26.03]Caught up in a world of uphill climbing.
[01:30.31]The tears in my eyes. And nothing is rhyming.
[01:33.70]Oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking.
But I sent you away.
Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking.
And I need you today. Oh Mandy.
[01:55.18]Yesterday's a dream. I face the morning.
[01:59.43]Crying on a breeze, the pain is calling.
[02:02.98]Oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking.
[02:09.41]But I sent you away.
[02:20.82]Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking.
[02:27.56]And I need you today.
[02:29.41]Oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking.
[02:36.31]But I sent you away.
[02:37.89]Oh Mandy, well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking.
[02:45.16]And I need you today.
[02:46.59]Oh Mandy, well you came and you gave without taking.
[02:53.13]But I sent you away.
[02:55.01]Oh Mandy!
