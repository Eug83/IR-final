[00:16.40]Love, can't you see I'm alone?
[00:22.43]Can't you give this fool a chance?
[00:25.96]A little love is all I ask. A little kindness in the night.
[00:34.48]Please don't leave me behind. No, don't tell me love is blind.
[00:41.97]A little love is all I ask and that is all.
[00:49.64]Ooh love, I've been searchin' so long.
[00:56.87]I've been searchin' high and low.
[01:00.15]A little love is all I ask. A little sadness when you're gone.
[01:09.16]Maybe you need a friend, only please don't let's pretend.
[01:16.94]A little love is all I ask and that is all.
[01:23.93]I wanna spread my wings,
[01:28.20]but I just can't fly as a string of pearls.
[01:34.66]Pretty girls go sailing by.
[01:40.74]Ocean deep,
[01:46.90]I'm so afraid to show my feelings.
[01:51.08]I have sailed a million sealings and a solitary rule.
[01:58.75]Ocean deep,
[02:04.14]will I ever find a lover? Maybe she had found another.
[02:12.38]And as I cry myself to sleep,
[02:17.51]I know this love of mine, I'll keep. Ocean deep.
[02:31.71]MUSIC
[02:41.37]Love, can't you hear when I call?
[02:47.60]Can't you hear a word I say?
[02:51.08]A little love is all I ask. A little feelin' when we touch.
[02:59.73]Why am I still alone? I've got a heart without a home.
[03:07.32]A little love is all I ask and that is all.


[03:14.58]I wanna spread my wings,
[03:18.69]but I just can't fly as a string of pearls.
[03:25.08]Pretty girls go sailing by.
[03:31.35]Ocean deep, I'm so afraid to show my feelings.
[03:41.61]I have sailed a million sealings and a solitary rule.
[03:49.41]Ocean deep, will I ever find a lover?
[03:58.84]Maybe she had found another.
[04:03.14]And as I cry myself to sleep,
[04:08.23]I know this love of mine, I'll keep. Ocean deep.
[04:19.49]I'm so lonely lonely lonely. (baby, baby, ocean deep)
[04:28.34]On my own, in my room. I'm so lonely lonely... (ocean deep)
[04:45.00]I'm so lonely, oh so lonely. This love of mine I'll keep.
