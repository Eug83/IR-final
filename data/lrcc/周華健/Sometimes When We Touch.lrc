[00:13.58]You asked me if I love you
[00:16.81]And I choke on my reply
[00:20.87]I'd rather hurt you honestly
[00:24.71]than missed you with a lie
[00:28.79]And who am I to judge you
[00:33.06]on what you say or do
[00:36.77]I'm only just beginning
[00:40.78]to see the real you
[00:46.95]And somtimes when we touch
[00:50.67]The honesty is too much
[00:54.39]And I have to close my eyes and hide
[01:02.26]I wanna hold you till I die
[01:06.13]Till we both break down and cry
[01:10.01]I wanna hold you till the fear in me subside
[01:16.87]
[01:22.88]Romance and all its strategy
[01:26.49]Leaves me battling with pride
[01:30.55]But thur the insecurity
[01:34.09]some tendeness survives
[01:38.51]I'm just another writer
[01:42.71]still trapped whin my truth
[01:46.82]A hesilant prize fighters
[01:50.78]still trapped with my youth
[01:57.05]And somtimes when we touch
[02:00.58]The honesty is too much
[02:04.29]And I have to close my eyes and hide
[02:12.23]I wanna hold you till I die
[02:16.31]Till we both break down and cry
[02:20.17]I wanna hold you till the fear in me subside
[02:27.39]
[02:28.90]At times I'd like to break you
[02:33.15]And drive you to your knees
[02:36.64]At times I'd like to break thur
[02:40.83]And hold you endlessly
[02:47.25]At times I understand you
[02:50.81]I know how hard you try
[02:55.00]I've watched while love command you
[02:58.60]And I've watched love pass you by
[03:02.64]At times I think we're drifters
[03:06.93]Still searching for a friend
[03:10.71]a brother or a sister
[03:14.34]But then the passion flares again
[03:20.95]And sometimes when we touch
[03:24.75]The honesty is too much
[03:28.47]And I have to close my eyes and hide
[03:36.18]I wanna hold you till I die
[03:40.52]Till we both break down and cry
[03:44.14]I wanna hold you till the fear in me subside
