[00:05.51]You asked me what I want 
[00:07.90]you asked me what I need 
[00:11.20]It's nothing you can buy 
[00:13.69]my heart's not ruled by greed 
[00:17.14]I don't give diamond 
[00:20.07]diamonds you see through 
[00:23.66]I want you to hold me 
[00:26.66]I want you to be true 
[00:32.76]Give me the gift of love Look me in the eyes
[00:40.85]Say I'm the oneyou're dreaming of 
[00:45.60]That would be the best surprise 
[00:50.56]Give me the gift of your sweet love 
[00:55.83]In the light of the day　
[00:58.94]In the dark of night Like
[01:08.58]the colours of the sun 
[01:11.50]the feelings in your heart 
[01:14.97]It's all I want from you 
[01:17.47]and whne the sky is dark 
[01:20.70]I'll have you beside me
[01:23.62]who could ask for more 
[01:26.77]I'll just wear a smile 
[01:29.68]when you walk in the door

[01:36.44]Give me the gift of love　
[01:41.16]Look me in the eyes
[01:43.92]Say I'm the oneyou're dreaming of 
[01:48.28]That would be the best surprise 
[01:53.57]Give me the gift of your sweet love

[03:04.04]In the dark of night Like

[03:09.36]Give me the gift of love　
[03:12.92]Look me in the eyes
[03:16.82]Say I'm the oneyou're dreaming of
