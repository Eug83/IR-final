[00:11.31]Outside the rain begins and it may never end
[00:19.05]So cry no more on the shore
[00:22.80]A dream will take us out to sea
[00:30.94]forever more, forever more
[00:39.25]Close your eyes and dream
[00:44.56]and you can be with me
[00:49.14]Neath the waves, through the caves of hours
[00:55.13]Long forgotten now
[01:00.76]We're all alone. We're all alone
[02:08.92][01:09.14]Close the window,calm the light
[02:14.70][01:14.61]and it will be all right
[02:18.30][01:18.48]No need to bother now
[02:22.76][01:22.99]Let it out, let it all begin
[01:29.05]Learn how to pretend
[01:33.14]
[01:38.94]Once a story's told
[01:44.61]it can't help but grow old
[01:48.90]Roses do, lovers too
[01:52.34]So cast your seasons to the wind
[02:00.48]And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear

[02:29.27]All's forgotten now, my love
[02:34.71]We're all alone. We're all alone

[02:43.30]Close the window, calm the light
[02:48.43]and it will be all right
[02:52.33]No need to bother now
[02:56.79]Let it out, let it all begin
[03:44.97][03:02.87]All's forgotten now,my love
[03:50.38][03:08.51]We're all alone. We're all alone
[03:58.67][03:18.71]
