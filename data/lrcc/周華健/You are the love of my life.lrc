[00:07.00]詞：       曲：
[00:07.00]
[00:13.00]You are the love of my life
[00:20.00]You are the reason I'm alive
[00:25.00]And baby baby baby
[00:28.00]When I think of how you saved me
[00:31.00]I go cracy, oh......
[00:39.00]And I've never known love like is
[00:46.00]It fills me with a new tenderness
[00:51.00]You're in my heart and you're in my soul
[00:58.00]You're all I can't resist
[01:06.00]And I need to tell you
[01:12.00]The first time I held you
[01:16.00]I knew, you are the love of my life
[03:09.00][01:29.00]And I spend a life time waiting
[03:14.00][01:33.00]Always hesistating until you
[03:23.00][01:43.00]I was lost so deep inside my shell
[03:26.00][01:46.00]Till you came and saved me from myself
[03:30.00][01:49.00]Now all I really know is I need you
[02:00.00]You are the love of my life
[02:06.00]And all the joy and tears that I cry
[02:12.00]And baby baby baby
[02:15.00]You don't have to say the word
[02:18.00]I see it in your eyes
[02:26.00]'Cause we stand together
[02:33.00]I promise forever till the day that I die
[02:42.00]You are the love of my life
[03:41.00]You are the love of my life
[03:47.00]You are the reason I'm alive
