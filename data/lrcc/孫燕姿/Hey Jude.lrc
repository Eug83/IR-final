[00:01.16]孫燕姿 - Hey Jude

[00:03.24]

[00:06.48]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.

[00:12.61]Take a sad song and make it better.

[00:19.91]Remember to let her into your heart,

[00:24.50]Then you can start to make it better.

[00:32.17]Hey Jude, don't be afraid.

[00:38.43]You were made to go out and get her.

[00:45.72]The minute you let her under your skin,

[00:50.69]Then you begin to make it better.

[00:59.70]And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,

[01:06.06]Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.

[01:15.80]For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool

[01:22.30]By making his world a little colder.

[01:39.32]Hey Jude, don't let me down.

[01:45.39]You have found her, now go and get her.

[01:51.36]Remember to let her into your heart,

[01:57.86]Then you can start to make it better.

[02:05.99]So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,

[02:12.52]You're waiting for someone to perform with.

[02:22.32]And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,

[02:28.87]The movement you need is on your shoulder.

[02:45.24]Hey Jude, don't make it bad.

[02:52.58]Take a sad song and make it better.

[02:58.66]Remember to let her under your skin,

[03:04.16]Then you'll begin to make it

[03:08.09]Better better better better better better, oh.

[03:16.66]Da da da da da da, da da da, hey Jude...

[04:29.00] end
