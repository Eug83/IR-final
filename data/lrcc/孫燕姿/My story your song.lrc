[02:33.00][01:33.64][00:30.07]Is your smile genuine
[02:35.10][01:35.76][00:31.99]Are you that really kind
[02:37.20][01:37.92][00:34.17]Do you like money & what it can bring
[02:45.74][01:50.79][00:42.68]Where would you wanna hide
[02:47.71][01:52.63][00:44.89]What would you seek
[02:49.77][01:52.63][00:46.76]Would you want what you thought
[02:52.17][01:57.16][00:49.16]What you want if no one can see
[03:49.63][03:45.43][03:03.10][03:11.60][01:00.18]See the pretty lights pretty smiles a long way from home
[03:58.62][03:53.94][03:11.33][01:08.10]See the wretched stars burnt-out sun Out on your own
[04:02.31][03:19.86][01:17.04]See our story come sing along What would you know
[04:13.70][04:11.62][04:09.46][03:26.95][01:28.34][01:23.72]This is your song
[03:28.20]Oh I know where I』d rather be
[03:35.79]So I』m holding on & going strong
[03:38.47]Joining the wrists we must be
[03:40.53]giving good we』ll be good as new
