[00:02.00]Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough
[00:18.00]
[00:23.02]<-3->
[00:24.02]<-2->
[00:25.02]<-1->
[00:26.02]I don't wanna lose you,
[00:28.85]but I don't wanna use you
[00:31.75]just to have somebody by my side.
[00:37.30]And I don't wanna hate you,
[00:40.35]I don't wanna take you,
[00:43.09]but I don't wanna be the one to cry.
[00:48.86]And that don't really matter
[00:54.88]to anyone anymore.
[01:00.54]But like a fool I keep losing my place
[01:04.89]and I keep seeing you walk through that door.
[01:10.13]
[02:28.87][01:10.48]But there's a danger in loving somebody too much,
[02:34.61][01:16.54]and it's sad when you know
[02:37.25][01:19.21]it's your heart you can't trust.
[02:40.48][01:22.50]There's a reason why people
[02:43.58][01:25.44]don't stay where they are.
[02:46.23][01:28.17]Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough.
[02:51.39][01:33.50]
[01:43.97]Now, I could never change you,
[01:46.83]I don't wanna blame you.
[01:49.65]Baby, you don't have to take the fall.
[01:55.44]Yes, I may have hurt you,
[01:58.29]but I did not desert you.
[02:01.19]Maybe I just wanna have it all.
[02:05.58]
[02:06.93]It makes a sound like thunder,
[02:12.42]it makes me feel like rain.
[02:18.33]And like a fool who will never see the truth,
[02:22.76]I keep thinking something's gonna change.
[02:52.08]And there's no way home,
[02:57.83]when it's late at night and you're all alone.
[03:03.60]Are there things that you wanted to say?
[03:09.22]do you feel me beside you in your bed,
[03:15.35]there beside you, where I used to lay?
[03:20.50]
[03:40.95]And there's a danger in loving somebody too much,
[03:46.88]and it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch.
[03:52.82]There's a reason why people don't stay who they are.
[03:58.31]Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough.
[04:04.15]Baby, sometimes, love...
[04:09.50]it just ain't enough.
[04:15.54]Oh...
