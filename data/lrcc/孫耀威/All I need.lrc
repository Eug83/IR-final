[00:14.00]
[00:16.00]Kissin' you was not what I had planned
[00:23.00]and now I'm not so sure just where I stand
[00:30.00]I wasn't looking for true love
[00:34.00]but now yor're looking  at me
[00:38.00]you're the only one I can think of
[00:41.00]you're the only  one I see
[02:29.00][01:52.00][00:46.00]All I need.
[02:35.00][01:58.00][00:52.00] Is just a little more time to be sure
[02:39.00][02:02.00][00:57.00]What I feel is it all in my mind
[02:44.00][01:02.00]cuz it seems so hard to believe
[02:49.00][01:06.00]that you're All I need
[01:20.00] I guess  It's true we've all been hurt beefore
[01:28.00]but it doesn't seem to matter anymore.
[01:36.00]It may be a chance we're taking.
[01:39.00] But it always comes to this if
[01:43.00]this isn't love we're making
[01:46.00]and I don't know what it is
[02:52.00]No stars are out tonight.
[02:55.00]but we're shining our own light
[02:59.00]and It's nerer felt so right
[03:04.00]Cuz girl the way I'm feeling
[03:08.00]it's easy to believe
[03:12.00]that you're all I need.
[03:19.00]OH... you're all I need. Ah...
