[02:33.00][00:42.00]same cat wth them evil eyes
[02:36.00][00:45.00]and I knew it was a spell she'd cast
[03:12.00][02:41.00][01:47.00][00:50.00]she's just a devil woman
[03:15.00][02:43.00][01:50.00][00:52.00]with evil on her mind

[01:39.00]then I looked in those big green eyes
[01:43.00]and I wondered what I came there for
