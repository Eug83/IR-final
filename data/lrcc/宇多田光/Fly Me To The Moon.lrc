Fly Me to the Moon (In Other Words)
Written by Utada Hikaru
Fly Me to the Moon by Frank Sinatra

[00:00.23]Poets often use many words
[00:05.52]To say a simple thing
[00:11.00]It takes thought and time and rhyme
[00:17.33]To make a poem sing

[00:23.16]With music and words I've been playing
[00:28.43]For you I have written a song
[00:34.46]To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
[00:39.90]I'll translate as I go along

[00:46.61]Fly me to the moon
[00:50.98]And let me play among the stars
[00:57.03]won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
[01:08.36]In other words: Hold my hand!
[01:13.27]In other words: Darling kiss me!

[01:18.65]Fill my heart with song,
[01:22.71]And let me sing forever more
[01:28.93]Cause you are all long for all I worship and adore
[01:39.12]In other words: Please be true!
[01:45.04]In other words: I love you!
[01:52.28]
[02:13.08]In other words: Please be true!
[02:20.88]In other words: I love you!
[02:32.76]《Thank you for use! --Made by Spansih Groo》
