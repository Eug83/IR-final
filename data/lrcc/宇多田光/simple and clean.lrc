Simple And Clean

[00:00.00]When you walk away
[00:02.91]You don't hear me say
[00:05.83]please Oh baby, don't go
[00:11.09]Simple and clean is the way that
[00:14.84]you're making me feel tonight
[00:18.91]It's hard to let it go
[00:25.89]You're giving me
[00:30.72]too many things Lately
[00:36.59]you're all I need
[00:42.20]You smiled at me and said
[00:46.86]Don't get me wrong I love you
[00:49.56]But does that mean I have to meet your father?
[00:54.88]When we are older you'll understand
[00:59.23]What I meant when I said No
[01:03.52]I don't think life is quite that simple
[01:08.58]When you walk away
[01:10.95]You don't hear me say
[01:13.83]please Oh baby, don't go
[01:19.18]Simple and clean is the way that
[01:23.10]you're making me feel tonight
[01:26.83]It's hard to let it go
[01:36.13]The daily things
[01:41.44]that keep us all busy
[01:46.66]Are confusing me
[01:52.13]That's when you came to me and said
[01:57.50]Wish I could prove I love you
[02:00.26]But does that mean I have to walk on water?
[02:05.97]When we are older you'll understand
[02:09.93]It's enough when I say so
[02:14.32]And maybe some things are that simple
[02:19.27]When you walk away
[02:21.61]You don't hear me say
[02:24.18]please Oh baby, don't go
[02:29.95]Simple and clean is the way that
[02:33.91]you're making me feel tonight
[02:37.92]It's hard to let it go
[02:41.09]Hold me
[02:43.57]Whatever lies beyond this morning
[02:48.62]Is a little later on
[02:51.60]Regardless of warnings the future
[02:55.39]doesn't scare me at all
[02:59.67]Nothing's like before
[03:03.01]When you walk away
[03:05.37]You don't hear me say
[03:08.17]please Oh baby, don't go
[03:13.62]Simple and clean is the way that
[03:17.61]you're making me feel tonight
[03:21.52]It's hard to let it go
[03:24.57]Hold me
[03:27.32]Whatever lies beyond this morning
[03:32.14]Is a little later on
[03:35.02]Regardless of warnings the future
[03:39.06]doesn't scare me at all
[03:43.25]Nothing's like before
[03:46.56]Hold me
[03:48.87]Whatever lies beyond this morning
[03:54.00]Is a little later on
[03:56.81]Regardless of warnings the future
[04:00.82]doesn't scare me at all
[04:04.82]Nothing's like before
