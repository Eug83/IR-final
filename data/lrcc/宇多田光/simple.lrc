Kingdom Hearts歐美版的片尾曲

[00:00.00]When you walk away
[00:03.01]You don't hear me say please
[00:07.89]Oh baby, don't go
[00:11.45]Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
[00:19.29]It's hard to let it go
[00:25.90]You're giving me too many things
[00:35.00]Lately, you're all I need
[00:42.36]You smiled at me and said,

[00:45.81]Don't get me wrong I love you
[00:49.83]But does that mean I have to meet your father?
[00:55.26]When we are older you'll understand
[00:59.48]What I meant when I said "No,
[01:04.10]I don't think life is quite that simple"

[01:08.51]When you walk away
[01:11.20]You don't hear me say please
[01:16.18]Oh baby, don't go
[01:19.33]Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
[01:27.13]It's hard to let it go

[01:31.52][so simple and clean]
[01:36.84]The daily things [like this and that and what is what]
[01:42.33]That keep us all busy
[01:47.04]Are confusing me
[01:52.16]That's when you came to me and said,

[01:56.49]Wish I could prove I love you
[02:00.51]But does that mean I have to walk on water?
[02:06.12]When we are older you'll understand
[02:10.14]It's enough when I say so
[02:14.74]And maybe some things are that simple

[03:04.59][02:19.24]When you walk away
[03:06.79][02:22.05]You don't hear me say please
[03:11.65][02:26.81]Oh baby, don't go
[03:14.90][02:30.35]Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
[03:22.79][02:37.87]It's hard to let it go

[02:41.17]Hold me
[02:43.83]Whatever lies beyond this morning
[02:48.59]Is a little later on
[02:51.52]Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
[02:59.95]Nothing's like before

[03:48.11][03:26.24]Hold me
[03:50.22][03:28.77]Whatever lies beyond this morning
[03:55.32][03:33.45]Is a little later on
[03:58.45][03:36.48]Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
[04:06.98][03:44.81]Nothing's like before
