[03:51.00][03:33.00][03:16.00][02:24.00][01:15.00][00:24.00]Goodbye 錯得太多 你自作你自受
[03:55.00][03:20.00][00:28.00]說謊都需要講對手
[03:38.00][02:29.00][01:20.00]放手不需要等太久
[03:59.00][03:42.00][03:25.00][02:33.00][01:24.00][00:32.00]Goodbye 你天生不羈 我都有自由
[04:04.00][03:29.00][00:36.00]我走 拜託另覓女友
[03:46.00][02:37.00][01:28.00]你走 別著像怪獸
[01:50.00][00:41.00]我說得瀟灑與輕鬆 努力去自控
[01:54.00][00:45.00]我假裝真的看通
[00:49.00]Oh No
[01:58.00]Yeah
[01:59.00][00:50.00]有過的愛突然間失了蹤
[02:03.00][00:54.00]發現大腦真空
[02:59.00][02:08.00][00:59.00]即使傷心得希望痛哭
[03:03.00][02:11.00][01:02.00]自尊卻不批准我失控
[03:06.00][02:15.00][01:05.00]Oh No
[03:08.00][02:16.00][01:07.00]這一分鐘這樣難受
[03:12.00][02:20.00][01:11.00]而難道我都不要走
Ya seen him creeping, cheating,
running round the bar
But girl don't shed a tear
coz you're a superstar
You're better off without,
you're bad by ya self
Go findyourself another,
put that scrub back on the shelf
Smile tonight, you look good, you feel great
Don't waste your time,
ain't no need to play ya hate
You loved to love him, that was clear,
say goodbye
Girl, tonight, your look can fly

Hit the dance floor, run a microphone check
As the DJ spins don'e even begin to let
That other get the best of you
From so many others, girl,
tonight you've got to choose
Now lose the loser you gotta
choose a new love for life
You and your crew are looking find tonight
See you caught his eye
Let the scrub go, girl, say goodbye
