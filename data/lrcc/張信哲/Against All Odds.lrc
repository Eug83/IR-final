[00:02.96]Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)
[00:05.87]Lyrics:Phil Collins Music:Phil Collins

[00:30.92]
[00:35.75]How can I just let you walk away
[00:39.09]Just let you leave without a trace
[00:43.10]When I stand here taking every breath with you
[00:51.58]You're the only one who really knew me at all
[00:58.88]
[01:00.77]How can you just walk away from me
[01:04.19]When all I can do is watch you leave
[01:08.36]'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
[01:12.90]And even shared the tears
[01:16.78]You're the only one who really knew me at all

[02:29.20][01:24.10]So take a look at me now
[02:33.63][01:28.59]Who has just an empty space
[02:38.02][01:33.00]And there's nothing left here to remind me
[02:42.72][01:37.46]Just a memory of your face

[01:40.84]Well take a look at me now
[01:45.61]There's just an empty space
[01:49.79]And you comin' back to me is against the odds
[01:54.52]And that's what I've got to face
[02:00.96]
[02:05.43]I wish I could just make you turn around
[02:09.84]Turn around and see me cry
[02:13.51]There's so much I need to say to you
[02:17.56]So many reasons why
[02:21.93]You're the only one who really knew me at all

[02:45.95]Now take a look at me now
[02:50.36]There's just an empty space
[02:55.11]But to wait for you is all I can do
[02:59.49]And that's what I've got to face
[03:47.04][03:19.69][03:02.64]Take a look at me now
[03:50.35][03:43.44][03:24.24][03:06.73]

[03:28.80]And you comin' back to me is against the odds
[03:33.04]Is the chance I've gotta take
