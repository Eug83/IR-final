[00:18.45]I saw an old friend of ours today
[00:25.32]She asked about you
[00:27.56]I didn't quite know what to say
[00:32.35]Heard you've been making the rounds
[00:35.83]round here
[00:38.71]While I've been trying to
[00:41.81]make tears disappear
[00:44.05]
[02:41.38][01:43.04][00:44.76]Now I'm almost over you
[02:48.30][01:50.12][00:51.71]I've almost should be blues
[02:54.96][01:56.29][00:58.37]So when you come back around
[02:58.22][01:59.96][01:01.47]After painting the town
[03:01.25][02:02.73][01:04.65]You'll see I'm almost over you
[02:09.19][01:11.20]
[01:16.68]You're such a sly one with your
[01:19.54]cold cold heart
[01:23.27]Maybe leaving came easy
[01:26.17]But it tore me apart
[01:30.55]Time hears all wounds they say
[01:33.24]And I sure know
[01:36.61]Cause it seems like forever
[01:39.79]but I'm letting you go

(repeat *)

[02:11.33]I can forgive you and soon I'll forget
[02:16.66]All those shattered dreams
[02:24.90]Although you left me with nothing to show
[02:30.18]for the misery

(repeat *)

[03:08.66]When you come back around
[03:12.17]After painting the town
[03:15.39]You'll see I'm almost over you
[03:23.17]
