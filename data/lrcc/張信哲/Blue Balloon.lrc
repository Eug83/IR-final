BLUE BALLOON
[00:01.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:05.00]

[00:07.19]I have a blue balloon,a happy tune
[00:13.17]Love enough to last me all through the afternoon
[00:19.47]I have the New York time and 14 dimes
[00:25.45]And expectations of the most profound nursery rhyme
[02:59.41][01:58.21][00:35.11]Before the rivers run dry
[03:07.13][02:05.51][00:42.38]Before the last say good-bye
[03:13.23][02:11.92][00:48.64]Let's be kind to one another
[03:19.74][02:18.24][00:55.10]We can try
[01:02.84]So don't just throw your love above
[01:08.98]It's not too late to find out
[01:16.11]Before the sand has all run out of the hour glass
[01:30.03]The carnival is here
[01:32.80]The crown appears
[01:35.99]Plastic painted people hold each other near
[01:42.08]Hopes are always high
[01:45.13]The echo of the sky and when it's over
[01:50.13]There just a lonely sight of good-bye
[02:22.76][01:55.86]
[02:31.85]Too late to hide it now
[02:34.57]It's all around us now
[02:37.66]Oh ! How I want you girl
[02:40.70]To lie beside me now
[02:43.86]While there still this time
[02:47.00]And now my balloon still rhyme
[02:50.04]Let me love you now
[02:52.23]We can drink a cool,good wine
[03:27.60]So don't just throw your love above
[03:33.76]You and me had last find out
[03:40.93]Before the sand has all run out of the hour-glass
[03:55.51]
