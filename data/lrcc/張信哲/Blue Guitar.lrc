[00:04.00]~Blue guitar~
[00:09.00]張信哲
[00:14.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:19.00]
[00:24.40]Play my solitary guitar
[00:27.94]Recall the moments sweet and bitter
[00:32.23]Until the emptiness is filled with dreams of you
[00:39.39]
[00:40.70]Thoughts that drift from past to present
[00:44.50]Wonder how your love is fading
[00:48.77]Are you by any chance comparing me with him
[00:56.45]
[02:45.79][00:57.41]Ooh Can I still cling to illusions
[02:52.49][01:04.11]That there'll be a solution
[02:58.27][01:09.82]Ooh Am I a fool still chasing shadows
[03:04.78][01:16.59]Without a star to follow
[03:09.32][01:20.80]But after all said and done
[03:13.35][01:24.79]I can't help wishing you well
[03:17.38][01:28.98]I still believe time will tell
[01:34.60]
[03:23.23][01:37.25]If he breaks your heart
[03:27.33][01:40.97]If he turns away
[03:31.53][01:45.12]I'll take up the part
[03:35.70][01:49.40]I won't ever stray
[03:39.96][01:53.49]So play blue guitar
[03:44.04][01:57.59]Play that sad refrain
[03:48.22][02:01.82]Carry me so far
[03:52.52][02:06.07]Till I feel no pain
[02:12.03]
[03:56.66]Play on blue guitar
[04:00.80]Play that sad refrain
[04:04.91]Carry me so far
[04:09.10]Take me from the pain
[04:17.28]
