[00:08.27]Good Night Girl
[00:32.53][00:19.40]
[00:35.30]You hear me so clearly
[00:40.29]And see how I try
[00:45.74]You feel me so heal me
[00:50.81]And tear me apart
[00:56.31]And I won't tell a soul
[01:01.08]I won't tell at all
[01:07.23]And do they have to know
[01:15.23]About my good night girl

[03:44.10][03:28.02][02:34.98][02:18.85][01:18.11]Cut up in your wishin' well
[03:47.07][03:31.03][02:37.82][02:22.06][01:20.53]Your hopes and sadness
[03:50.10][03:34.16][02:40.98][02:25.05][01:23.52]Take your love in promises
[03:53.25][03:37.28][02:44.05][02:27.90][01:27.06]You make them last
[03:57.05][03:41.36][02:47.85][02:32.05][01:31.01]You make them last
[04:02.22]
[01:36.12]You keep me so near you
[01:41.46]And see me so far
[01:46.82]And hold me and send me
[01:52.03]And deep in your heart
[01:57.46]And I won't tell a soul
[02:02.59]I won't tell at all
[02:08.07]And I won't let them know
[02:16.19]About my good night girl

[02:52.01]Doesn't matter how sad I made you
[02:57.19]Doesn't matter how hard I try
[03:02.20]Just remember the same old reason
[03:06.68]Reflected in your eyes
[03:08.81]You said you want me
[03:13.76]
