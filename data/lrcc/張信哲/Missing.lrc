Missing

[02:54.58][00:31.18]I step off the train
[02:58.50][00:34.84]I'm walking down your street again
[03:03.04][00:39.64]And past your door
[03:06.79][00:42.91]But you don't live there anymore
[03:10.57][00:47.25]It's years since you've been there
[03:15.73][00:52.39](And) Now you're disappeared somewhere like outer space
[03:39.30][03:23.32][00:59.95]You've found some better place
[03:49.70][03:41.66][03:25.58][01:10.16][01:02.14]And I miss you
[03:53.91][03:46.16][01:14.14][01:06.27]Like the deserts miss the rain
[03:30.01][01:17.74]
[01:19.67]Could you be dead?
[01:22.80]You always were two steps ahead of everyone
[01:30.90]We'd walk behind while you would run
[01:34.78]I look up at your house
[01:39.95]And I can almost hear you shout down to me
[01:46.22]Where I always used to be
[01:58.15][01:49.87]And I miss you
[02:02.09][01:54.15]Like the deserts miss the rain
[02:05.89]
[02:07.62]Back on the train
[02:10.72]I ask why did I come again
[02:15.43]Can I confess I've been hanging round your old dress
[02:23.10]And the years have proved to offer nothing since you moved
[02:32.46]You've long gone but I can't move on
[02:45.95][02:37.66]And I miss you
[02:49.96][02:42.06]Like the deserts miss the rain
[03:36.84][02:53.49]
[04:13.66][04:05.70][03:57.84][03:33.27]And I miss you
[04:25.83][04:17.95][04:09.81][04:01.90]Like the deserts miss the rain
