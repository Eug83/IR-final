One More Try
[03:41.04][00:06.62]Made by HandsomeCK
[04:06.26][03:39.20][00:14.64]
[00:27.23]I've had enough of danger
[00:32.90]And people on the streets
[00:38.53]I'm looking out for angels
[00:44.08]Just trying to find some peace
[00:49.66]Now I think it's time
[00:55.21]That you let me know
[01:00.60]So if you love me
[01:03.40]Say you love me
[01:06.11]But if you don't just let me go

[02:47.14][01:11.86]Cause teacher there are things
[02:52.79][01:17.39]That I don't want to learn
[02:58.20][01:22.90]And the last one I had
[03:03.72][01:28.67]Made me cry
[03:07.20][01:31.91]So I don't want to learn to
[03:09.40][01:34.00]hold you, touch you
[03:15.90][01:40.51]Think that you're mine
[03:19.44][01:44.13]Because it ain't no joy
[03:25.19][01:49.44]For an uptown boy
[03:27.83][01:52.33]Whose teacher has told him goodbye
[03:37.05][03:34.10][01:58.56]goodbye

[02:02.67]When you were just a stranger
[02:07.89]And I was at your feet
[02:13.73]I didn't feel the danger(no, but)
[02:19.43]Now I feel the heat
[02:25.04]That look in your eyes
[02:30.77]It's telling me no
[02:34.64]So you think that you love me
[02:38.01]Know that you need me
[02:41.07]I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
[02:43.55]Just let me go

[04:10.01]So when you say that you need me
[04:13.62]That you'll never leave me
[04:16.22]I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
[04:19.24]Let me go

[04:22.98]And teacher
[04:25.67]There are things that I still have to learn
[04:33.64]But the one thing I have is my pride
[04:40.50]Oh yeah
[04:42.76]So baby I don't want to
[04:44.54]hold you, touch you
[04:51.04]Think that you're mine
[04:54.68]Because it ain't no joy
[05:00.52]For an uptown boy
[05:03.54]Who just isn't willing to try
[05:08.85]I'm so cold, inside
[05:15.00]Maybe just one more try
[05:21.57]
