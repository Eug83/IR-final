Arranger:Reggi
[04:52.00][00:05.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[04:57.00][00:10.00]
[00:15.77]Met you by surprise
[00:18.60]I didn't realize
[00:21.96]That my life would change forever
[00:28.57]Saw you standing there
[00:31.92]I didn't know I'd care
[00:35.23]There was something special in the air
[00:41.84]Dreams are my reality
[00:46.51]The only kind of real fantasy
[00:54.23]Illusions are a common thing
[00:58.08]I try to live in dreams
[01:01.56]It seems as it's meant to be
[01:08.24]Dreams are my reality
[01:13.03]A different kind of reality
[01:20.89]I dream of loving in the night
[01:24.81]And loving seems alright
[01:28.21]Although it's only fantasy
[01:33.56]
[01:48.68]If you do exist
[01:51.72]Honey don't resist
[01:55.02]Show me a new way of loving
[02:01.67]Tell me that it's true
[02:05.00]Show me what you do
[02:08.25]I feel something special about you
[02:14.84]Dreams are my reality
[02:19.77]The only kind of reality
[02:27.22]Maybe my foolishness is past
[02:31.17]And maybe now at last
[02:34.46]I'll see how the real thing can be
[02:41.33]Dreams are my reality
[02:46.33]A wonderous world where I like to be
[02:53.61]I dream of holding you all night
[02:57.63]And holding you seems right
[03:01.15]Perhaps that's my reality
[03:06.55]
[03:31.07]Met you by surprise
[03:34.35]I didn't realize
[03:37.63]That my love would change forever
[03:44.21]Tell me that it's true
[03:47.54]Feeling that are new
[03:50.86]I feel something special about you
[03:57.46]Dreams are my reality
[04:02.33]A wonderous world where I like to be
[04:09.51]Illusions are a common thing
[04:13.79]I try to live in dreams
[04:17.22]Although it's only fantasy
[04:23.91]Dreams are my reality
[04:28.78]I like to dream of you close to me
[04:35.93]I dream of loving in the night
[04:40.11]And loving you seems right
[04:43.51]Perhaps that's my reality
