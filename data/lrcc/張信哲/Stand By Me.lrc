[00:05.60]Written:B.King/J.Leiber/M.Stoller
[02:39.41][00:27.22][00:07.63]
[02:29.58][00:19.47]Made by HandsomCK
[00:36.36]When the night has come
[00:42.69]And the land is dark
[00:45.49]And the moon is the only light we'll see
[00:52.55]
[00:54.44]No I won't be afraid
[00:58.35]Oh,I won't be afraid

When I play my guitar
On the comer of the street
For the people who don't know where to be
If my hands should grow tired
I'll still sing my song

[01:03.22]Just as long as you stand
[01:07.51]Stand by me
[01:10.66]And darling darling
[01:12.87]Stand by me oh stand by me
[01:21.07]Oh stand now stand by me
[01:26.42]Stand by me
[01:29.98]If the sky that we look upon
[01:35.80]Should tumble and fall
[01:38.94]Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
[01:46.13]
[02:41.74][01:47.92]I won't cry I won't cry
[02:45.10][01:51.82]No i won't shed a tear
[02:50.63][01:57.06]Just as long as you stand
[02:54.63][02:01.08]Stand by me
[02:57.85][02:04.22]And darling darling
[03:00.17][02:06.49]Stand by me oh stand by me
[03:07.94][02:14.28]Oh stand now stand by me
[03:13.70][02:20.12]Stand by me
[02:23.87]
[03:15.77]Whenever you're in trouble
[03:17.79]Won't you stand by me
[03:21.27]Oh stand by me
[03:25.91]Oh now stand now stand by me
