[00:05.00]~The Actor~
[00:10.00]張信哲
[00:15.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:20.00]
[00:24.72]He takes you out and he takes you up
[00:30.66]Cos' he can show you so much
[00:36.66]I go to bed and tomorrow again
[00:42.65]There's a lot of work to be done
[00:48.71]He gives you gold and he'll promise you
[00:54.65]The whole world will be yours
[01:00.57]I just can tell you I love you so
[01:06.55]Even though my odds are low
[03:58.51]
[04:00.55][03:36.54][02:48.60][02:24.54][01:12.30]I'm not an actor I'm not a star
[04:05.87][03:41.68][02:53.84][02:29.83][01:17.77]And I don't even have my own car
[04:12.61][03:48.39][03:00.53][02:36.57][01:24.51]But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
[04:18.53][03:54.46][03:06.52][02:42.53][01:30.57]That you will love me anyway
[04:23.68][03:11.94][01:35.17]
[01:36.61]The dirty games and the neon shows
[01:42.56]This is the world he knows
[01:48.50]Watching the stars satisfies my soul
[01:54.41]Thinking of him makes me feel so cold
[02:00.57]The fancy cars and the restaurants
[02:06.50]You're just so fond of the man
[02:12.45]Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
[02:18.52]Can't you see he's got dirt on his mind
