Written:Paul Francis Webster/Jerry Livingston
[04:15.00][02:30.00][00:05.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[04:25.00][02:40.00][00:15.00]
[00:25.11]You ask me how much I need you,must I explain?
[00:36.95]I need you, oh my darling,like roses need rain
[00:48.80]You ask how long I'll love you
[00:54.44]I'll tell you true
[01:00.51]Until the Twelfth of Never,I'll still be loving you
[02:47.35][01:12.41]Hold me close
[02:53.27][01:18.31]Never let me go
[02:59.24][01:24.22]Hold me close
[03:05.13][01:30.10]Melt my heart like April snow
[01:37.79]
[03:13.97][01:38.83]I'll love you'til the bluebells forget to bloom
[03:25.40][01:50.48]I'll love you'til the clover has lost its perfume
[03:37.29][02:02.21]I'll love you'til the poets run out of rhyme
[03:49.15][02:14.08]Until the Twelfth of Never
[03:55.07][02:19.94]And that's a long,long time
[02:26.02]
[04:01.10]Until the Twelfth of Never
[04:07.00]And that's a long, long time
[04:13.08]
