[00:02.00]The Color Of The Night
[00:08.00]written by Jud J.Friedman/Lauren Christy/Dominic Frontiere
[00:12.00]
[00:18.00]You and I moving in the dark
[00:26.00]Bodies close but souls apart
[00:34.00]Shadowed smiles and secrets unrevealed
[00:42.00]I need to know the way you feel
[00:48.00]
[02:01.00][00:49.00]I'll give you everything I am
[02:06.00][00:54.00]And everything I want to be
[02:09.00][00:58.00]I'll put it in your hands
[02:14.00][01:02.00]If you could open up to me oh
[02:18.00][01:06.00]Can't we ever get beyond this wall
[02:23.00][01:12.00]'Cause all I want is just once
[02:30.00][01:18.00]To see you in the light
[02:34.00][01:22.00]But you hide behind
[02:36.00][01:24.00]The color of the night
[01:29.00]
[01:30.00]I can't go on running from the past
[01:38.00]Love has torn away this mask
[01:44.00]And now like clouds, like rain
[01:50.00]I'm drowning and I blame it all on you
[01:55.00]I'm lost, god save me
[02:00.00]
[02:44.00](un...........the color of the night  yeah...)
[02:53.00]
[03:02.00]Everything I am
[03:06.00]And everything I want to be your
[03:10.00]Can't we ever get beyond this wall
[03:16.00]Cause all I want is just once
[03:22.00]Forever and again
[03:26.00]I'm waiting for you, I'm standing in the light
[03:34.00]But you hide behind the color of the night
[03:45.00]
[03:49.00]Please come out from
[03:51.00]The color of the night
[03:59.00]
[04:08.00]The End
