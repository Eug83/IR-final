[00:14.31]Ooh, well, too much heaven
[00:26.28]
[00:29.20]Ooh you and me girl got a lot of love in store
[00:33.93]And it flows through you, and it flows through me

[02:35.63][01:28.17]It's as high as a mountain
[02:38.87][01:31.35]And harder to climb
[02:42.55]
[01:34.74]Ah, you and me boy, got a highway to tthe sky
[01:41.36]We can turn away, from the night and day
[01:44.15]And all the tears we had to pour
[01:46.58]You're my life
[01:50.56]I can see a new tomorrow
[01:53.21]Everything we are will never die
[01:58.51]Loving's such a beautiful thing, so beautiful

[02:57.69]Love's so beautiful
[02:59.63]You made my world a summer day
[03:04.94]Are you just a dream to fade away(to fade away)
[04:06.46][03:13.58]
[04:08.12][03:42.65][03:17.35]Nobody gets too much heaven no more
[04:12.65][03:47.18][03:21.96]It's much harder to come by
[04:16.04][03:50.63][03:25.31]I'm waiting in line
[03:55.43][03:29.96]Nobody gets too much love anymore
[03:59.97][03:34.58]It's as wide as a river and harder to find
