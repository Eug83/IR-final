True
[00:06.70]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:11.87]
[00:22.97]So true, funny how it seems
[00:27.88]Always in time
[00:29.84]But never in line for dreams
[00:34.33]Head over heels, when toe to toe
[00:39.96]This is the sound of my soul
[00:45.42]This is the sound
[02:55.16][00:49.40]I found a ticket to the world
[03:00.42][00:55.20]But now I've come back again
[03:06.43][01:01.12]Why do I find it hard to write the next line
[03:10.64][01:05.31]Oh, I want the truth to be said
[03:16.28][01:10.26]
[03:20.05][02:27.83][01:12.01]Ha,ha,ha,ha
[03:24.47][02:32.66][01:16.30]I know this much is true
[03:30.74][02:38.81][01:22.10]Ha,ha,ha,ha
[03:46.06][03:35.42][02:43.24][01:27.43]I know this much is true(baby it's so true)
[04:04.92][03:43.31][01:38.46]
[01:39.01]With a thrill in my head
[01:41.70]And a pill on my tongue
[01:45.56]This for the nerves that've just begun
[01:50.38]Listening to Marvin(all night long)

[01:56.33]This is the sound of my soul
[02:01.48]This is the sound
[02:06.58]Always slipping from my hands
[02:11.87]Signs the time of its own
[02:16.98]Take your seaside arms and write the next line
[02:21.64]Oh, I want the truth to be know
