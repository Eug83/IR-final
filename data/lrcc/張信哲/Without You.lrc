[00:00.00]Without you
[00:07.00]
[00:08.00]No I can't forget this evening
[00:12.00]Or your face as you were leaving
[00:15.00]But I guess that's just the way
[00:19.00]The story goes
[00:23.00]You always smile but in your eyes
[00:27.00]You sorrow shows
[00:31.00]Yes it shows
[00:39.00]No I can't forget tomorrow
[00:43.00]When I think of all my sorrow
[00:47.00]When I had you there
[00:50.00]But then I let you go
[00:54.00]And now it's only fair
[00:58.00]That I should let you know
[01:02.00]What you should know

[03:03.00][02:16.00][01:11.00]I can't live
[03:08.00][02:20.00][01:15.00]If living is without you
[03:11.00][02:24.00][01:19.00]I can't live
[03:15.00][02:28.00][01:23.00]I can't give anymore
[02:32.00][01:27.00]I can't live
[02:36.00][01:31.00]If living is without you
[02:40.00][01:35.00]I can't give
[02:44.00][01:39.00]I can't give anymore

[01:44.00]Well I can't forget this evening
[01:48.00]Or your face as you were leaving
[01:52.00]But I guess that's just the way
[01:56.00]The story goes
[01:59.00]You always smile but in your eyes
[02:03.00]You sorrow shows

[02:07.00]Yes it shows
