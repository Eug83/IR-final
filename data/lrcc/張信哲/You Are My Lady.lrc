[00:05.00]~You Are My Lady~
[00:10.00]張信哲
[00:15.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:20.00]
[00:24.53]Am I a fighter or a lover
[00:30.27]When I do both, can I survive
[00:35.96]But I need a quiet time and reason
[00:41.64]And I need you to feel alive
[00:47.46]When I get rain without the rainbow
[00:53.16]When all my plans are falling through
[00:58.79]I leave the others fighting over the rainbow
[01:04.60]And I come running home to you
[02:22.84][01:08.48]You're my lady
[02:26.00][01:11.74]Come let me hold you
[02:28.67][01:14.41]You are the star I wish on every evening
[02:34.48][01:20.33]You're my lady
[02:37.14][01:22.97]You are my world tonight
[02:40.91][01:26.58]My world tonight my lady
[01:33.19]
[01:38.97]About as often as I grieve
[01:44.53]I think of you and I am stronger
[01:50.15]With faith to try again or question why again
[01:55.88]To feel you close to feel so much
[02:01.66]And if I face on endless sleep
[02:07.32]You're all the things I choose to dream of
[02:13.09]To make the night worth while
[02:16.02]I'll think about your smile
[02:18.76]And of the days when I could touch you

[02:47.33]And early angel of the nights
[02:51.09]And you spend the nights with me
[02:55.91]In your arms my heart is hope
[02:59.36]It's like heaven just to me with you
[03:04.18]My lady come let me hold you
[03:08.61]You are the star I wish on every evening
[03:14.32]You're my lady
[03:17.09]You are my world tonight
[03:20.78]My world tonight
[03:23.79]I breathe for you my lady
[03:30.53]You are my lady
[03:37.29]
