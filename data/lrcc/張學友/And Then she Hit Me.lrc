[00:11.90]7:35 I came to life and threw my pants on
[00:16.92]and I searched for shoes to fit the groove to get my dance on to
[00:22.29]Take a ride into town down on main street where
[00:27.76]A friend of mine was playing live down at RBC's
[00:32.70]But girlfriend is taking so long
[00:38.10]Hogging the bathroom and the phone
[00:42.94]Then she had the nerve to say the words that I should click and go
[00:48.05]And don't change the mood wiht attitude and I said...
[00:51.91]you should talk
[00:53.55]Right then I knew I blew it Right then I stepped into it
[01:04.11]I Knew that I would need a drink to get through it
[01:09.02]She just turned aroud and smiled...
[01:12.25]And then she hit me And then she hit me
[01:25.51]We walked in at half past ten and the place was jacked
[01:35.56]Cut the casualties and made a bee line for the bar
[01:40.29]Surprised I made it cause the leash it only goes so for
[01:45.73]Long islands in my system I felt like Sonny liston
[01:55.85]By the second round I was going to town and she was in her coat
[02:01.08]I said I will find a ride tonight but baby you can go
[02:06.63]Right then I knew she blews it I found her drama anusing
[02:16.97]She took another drink and must've said screw it
[02:21.97]And she just turned around and smiled...
[02:25.55]And them she hit me And then she hit me
[02:40.84]I know I drive her crazy
[02:45.88]I bring out her best and worst
[02:51.15]It's not her fault she loves me but
[02:55.56]It's all my fault when she gets hurt
[03:22.43]Right I knew she lost it
[03:27.44]She drew line and I crossed it
[03:32.77]I was drinking like it's water from fauset
[03:37.73]ANd I just turned around and smiled....
[03:40.52]And then she hit me
[03:46.09]And then she hit me
[03:51.42]And then she hit me
