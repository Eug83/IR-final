[00:10.81]There were no angry words at all
[00:15.07]As we carried boxes down the hall
[00:20.44]One by one put them in your car
[00:30.47]Nothing much for us to say
[00:34.70]One last goodbye and you drove away
[00:38.88]I watched your tail-lights
[00:40.87]As they faded in the dark
[00:48.45]I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
[00:53.23]So I laid down on the couch instead
[02:31.82][00:59.39]Last night I prayed the lord my soul to keep
[02:37.86][01:05.38]Then I cried myself to sleep
[02:42.64][01:10.00]So sure life wouldn't go on without you
[02:52.15][01:19.90]But oh this sun is blinding me
[02:56.66][01:24.30]As it wakes me from the dark I guess the world didn't stop
[01:31.56]For my broken heart
[01:44.05]Clock still tickin', life goes on
[01:48.87]Radio still plays a song
[01:53.34]As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
[02:03.06]And it takes all the strength I've got
[02:07.57]To stumble to the coffee pot
[02:11.64]The first many lonely mornings
[02:15.66]I've got to face
[02:21.38]You call to see if I'm ok
[02:26.10]Look out the window and I just say
[03:04.14]For my broken heart
[03:11.00]I guess the world ain't gonna stop
[03:13.73]For my broken heart
