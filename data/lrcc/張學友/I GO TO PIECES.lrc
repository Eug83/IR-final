I Go To Pieces
　
[00:29.93]When I see you walking down the street
[00:34.00]I get so shaky and I feel so weak
[00:38.10]I tell my eyes look the other way
[00:42.05]But they don't listen to a word I say
[00:46.08]And I go to pieces and I wanna hide
[00:50.21]Go to pieces and I almost die
[00:53.88]Everytime my baby passes by
[00:59.33]
[01:06.37]I tell my arms to hold someone new
[01:10.40]Another love that will be true
[01:14.61]But they don't listen, they don't seem to care
[01:18.54]They reach for her but she's not there
[01:22.68]And I go to pieces and I wanna hide
[01:26.62]Go to pieces and I almost die
[01:29.92]Everytime my baby passes by
[01:36.71]
[01:50.41]I remember what you said
[01:51.91]When you said goodbye baby
[01:57.40]We'll meet again soon may be
[02:01.52]But until we do all my best to you
[02:10.01]I'm so lonely I think about you only
[02:16.86]
[02:17.75]I go to pieces we used to go
[02:21.66]But I know you'll never show
[02:25.80]You hurt me so much inside
[02:29.92]How I hope you're satisfied
[02:34.01]And I go to pieces and I wanna hide
[02:38.03]Go to pieces and I almost die
[02:41.35]Everytime my baby passes by
[02:49.68]
[02:50.23]Go to pieces and I (And I die)
[02:54.31]Go to pieces and I (wanna hide)
[02:58.33]Go to pieces and I, my baby
