[00:31.21]I wish Christmas could be good again
[00:38.34]That you could forget everything
[00:42.07]Just for one day I'd take you right back
[00:49.39]To when you were a little girl!
[00:53.23]To when each day promised you pearls
[00:57.09]Before you grew up
[02:39.25][01:01.60]And I wish that we owned the house we live in
[02:46.45][01:09.30]And I wish that we had no bills to pay
[02:54.46][01:16.94]And I wish I could find something this Christmas
[03:01.84][01:24.08]Something so valuable that it didn't cost
[03:12.17][01:33.11]Happy Christmas to you
[03:17.39][01:37.88]May all your dreams come true
[03:19.32][01:41.67]And may somebody save you tonight
[03:24.84][01:45.08]And may you still believe that I might
[03:27.26][01:49.26]And may some things just turn out all right
[03:37.32]just turn out all right
