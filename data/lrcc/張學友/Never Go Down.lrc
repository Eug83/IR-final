[00:15.43]Alone in the city Ain't no streets of gold
[00:21.74]Wallowing in self pity In a world so hard and cold
[00:28.07]Walking the streets in vain To a find a friendly face
[00:34.05]But all I got was pain
[00:37.07]And I was lost without a trace
[00:41.36]Scared and alone I didn't have the strength to carry on
[00:53.96]I thought that I would never win this fight
[00:58.57]Took solace in my loneliness
[01:01.38]But now I see the light
[01:04.90]Coz-l-oh l-oh l I'm never going down again
[01:17.11]I said I-oh-l l-oh-l
[01:22.75]I'm never going down again
[01:34.52]I've danced with the devil I have prayed to the Lord
[01:37.04]Drewned in a sea of sorrow
[01:39.40]My joie da vivre was overboard
[01:43.69]Too many broken hearts
[01:46.94]So much gone undone
[01:49.96]But I'm trying to find the spark
[01:53.05]And all the darknee overcome
[01:57.16]Looked to the sky
[03:21.63][02:02.88]I was searching for salvation from on high
[03:25.66][02:08.99]But hope springs eternal like true love
[03:29.96][02:14.22]And I made a vow somewhere somehow
[03:33.26][02:17.45]That I would rise above
[04:27.65][03:36.17][02:20.59]Coz l-oh-l oh-l I'm never going down again
[04:37.18][04:13.92][04:01.41][03:48.33][02:32.69]I said I-oh-l l-oh-l
[03:18.61][04:19.03][04:06.50][03:53.66][02:38.02]I'm never going down again
[04:23.97][03:13.16]Looked to the sky
