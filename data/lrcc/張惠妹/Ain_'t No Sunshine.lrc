[00:07.41]張惠妹
[00:12.14]MUSIC
[00:37.64]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[00:43.86]It's not warm when she's away
[00:49.94]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[00:54.57]And she's always gone too long
[00:57.48]Anytime she goes away
[01:03.56]Wonder this time where she's gone
[01:08.75]Wonder if she's gone to stay
[01:15.72]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:19.52]And this house just ain't no home
[01:22.19]Anytime she goes away
[01:31.31]And I know, I know...
[01:40.94]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:53.20]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[01:58.53]Only darkness everyday
[02:05.81]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[02:09.36]And this house just ain't no home
[02:12.07]Anytime she goes away
[02:18.56]Ain't no sunshine
[02:21.28]Ain't no sun Ain't no sun
[02:56.05][02:32.51]Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
[03:01.90]Anytime she goes away
[03:13.78][03:11.20][02:43.44]Ain't no sun
[03:16.95]she's always gone too long
