[00:01.57]Bizarre Love Triangle
[00:06.17]張惠妹
[00:11.22]
[00:25.99]Every time i think of you
[00:28.97]I get a shot right through
[00:30.59]Into a bolt of blue
[00:32.98]It`s no problem of mine
[00:34.70]But it`s a problem i find
[00:36.79]Living the life that i can`t leave behind
[00:40.41]There`s no sense in telling me
[00:43.75]The wisdom of a fool won`t set you free
[00:47.45]But that`s the way that it goes
[00:49.49]And it`s what nobody knows
[00:51.60]And every day my confusion grows
[01:19.63][00:56.87]
[03:38.25][03:23.47][03:08.65][02:53.80][02:24.40][02:09.23][01:02.90]Every time i see you falling
[03:41.94][03:27.03][03:12.25][02:57.46][02:27.89][02:13.10][01:06.55]I get down on my knees and pray
[03:30.66][03:15.99][03:01.17][02:31.40][02:16.37][01:09.78]I`m waiting for the final moment
[03:34.45][03:19.66][03:04.81][02:35.30][02:20.57][01:13.44]You say the words that i can`t say
[01:32.11]I feel fine and i feel good
[01:36.43]I feel like i never should
[01:39.40]Whenever i get this way
[01:41.18]I just don`t know what to say
[01:42.90]Why can`t we be ourselves like we were yesterday
[01:47.80]I`m not sure what this could mean
[01:51.36]I don`t think you`re what you seem
[01:54.19]I do admit to myself
[01:55.89]That if i hurt someone else
[01:57.83]Then i`ll never see just what we`re meant to be
[02:46.12][02:05.58]
