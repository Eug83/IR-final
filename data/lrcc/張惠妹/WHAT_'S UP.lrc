[00:00.00]WHAT'S UP
[00:14.00]
[04:44.00][04:16.00][03:48.00][02:10.00][00:46.00]And I say hey...
[04:51.00][04:24.00][03:56.00][02:18.00][00:54.00]I say hey What's going on.
[04:58.00][04:30.00][04:02.00][02:24.00][01:00.00]And I say hey
[05:05.00][04:37.00][04:09.00][02:32.00][01:08.00]I say hey What's going on
[04:43.00][04:15.00][02:37.00][01:13.00]
[01:16.00]25 years of my life and still.
[01:19.00]I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope.
[01:25.00]For a destination.
[01:29.00]I realized quickly when I knew I should.
[01:32.00]That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man.
[01:39.00]For whatever that means.
[01:41.00]
[03:21.00][01:43.00]So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed.
[03:24.00][01:47.00]To get it all out what's in my head.
[03:28.00][01:50.00]Then I start feeling a little peculiar.
[03:35.00][01:57.00]So I wake in the morning and I step outside.
[03:38.00][02:00.00]I take a deep breath I get real high.
[03:42.00][02:04.00]Then I scream from the top of my lungs What's going on.
[02:09.00]
[02:53.00]And I try, oh my god do I try.
[02:58.00]I try all the time
[03:02.00]In this institution.
[03:07.00]And I pray, oh my god do I pray.
[03:12.00]I pray every single day For a revolution.
[03:20.00]
