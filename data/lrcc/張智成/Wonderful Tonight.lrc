[00:05.00]~Wonderful Tonight~
[00:10.00]張智成
【專輯】凌晨三點鐘
詞曲：Eric Patrick Clapton
[00:15.00]Made by HandsomeCK
[00:20.00]
[00:23.88]It's late in the evening
[00:29.44]She's wondering what clothes to wear
[00:35.30]She puts on her make up
[00:40.85]And brushes her long blonde hair
[00:46.52]And then she asks me
[00:51.87]Do I look alright
[00:56.00]And I say yes
[00:58.50]You look wonderful tonight
[01:04.66]
[01:12.07]We go to a party
[01:19.56]And everyone turns to see
[01:26.07]This beautiful lady
[01:31.40]That's walking around with me
[01:36.99]And then she asks me
[01:40.75]Do you feel alright
[01:46.28]And I say yes
[01:49.01]I feel wonderful tonight
[01:55.50]
[01:58.05]I feel wonderful
[02:00.94]Because I see the love light in your eyes
[02:09.27]And the wonder of it all
[02:14.34]Is that you just don't realize how much I love you
[02:29.49]You're my girl
[02:37.06]I need your love
[02:44.84]It's time to go home now
[02:50.24]And I've got an aching head
[02:55.80]So I give her the car keys
[03:01.31]And she helps me into bed
[03:06.93]And then I tell her
[03:12.70]As I turn out the light
[03:16.83]I say my darling
[03:19.28]You were wonderful tonight
[03:25.57]
