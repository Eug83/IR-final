[00:12.28]It's a long long journey
[00:17.59]Till I know where  I'm supposed to be
[00:24.22]It's a long long journey
[00:29.13]And I don't know if I can believe
[00:35.58]When shadows fall and block my eyes
[00:41.11]I am lost and know that I must hide
[00:47.70]It's a long long journey
[00:53.12]Till I find my way home to you
[00:59.31]
[01:00.13]Many days I've spent
[01:05.28]Drifting on through empty shores
[01:10.80]Wondering what's my purpose
[01:16.50]Wondering how to make me strong
[01:20.95]
[01:22.43]I know I will falter I know I will cry
[01:28.11]I know you'll be standing by my side
[01:34.06]It's a long long journey
[01:39.62]And I need to be close to you
[01:45.27]
[01:46.40]Sometimes it feels no one understands
[01:51.77]I don't even know why
[01:55.01]I do the things I do
[01:58.13]When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul
[02:04.79]Will you break down these walls and pull me through?
[02:15.96]
[02:59.23][02:18.34]Cause It's a long long journey
[02:25.16]Till I feel that I am worth the price
[02:31.14]You paid for me on calvary
[02:37.33]Beneath those stormy skies
[02:42.56]
[02:43.18]When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes
[02:48.40]It feels like everything is out to make me lose control

[03:07.11]Till I find my way home to you...to you
