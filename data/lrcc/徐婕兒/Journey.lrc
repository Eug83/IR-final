[00:18.13][00:30.65][00:54.94][02:36.94]It's a long long journey
[00:23.70]Till I know where  I'm supposed to be
[00:36.24]And I don't know if I can believe
[00:42.87]When shadows fall and block my eyes
[00:48.56]I am lost and know that I must hide
[01:00.62]Till I find my way home to you
[01:09.72][02:49.52]Sometimes it feels no one understands
[01:16.13][02:55.55]I don't even know why
[01:19.06][02:58.81]I do the things I do
[01:21.71][03:01.88]When pride builds me up till I can't see my soul
[01:27.28][03:06.61]Will you break down these walls and pull me through?
[01:38.01][03:19.99][03:59.55]Cause It's a long long journey
[01:44.00][03:25.42]Till I feel that I am worth the price
[01:50.96][03:32.39]You paid for me on calvary
[01:57.23][03:38.80]Beneath those stormy skies
[02:02.94]
[02:24.54]I know I will falter I know I will cry
[02:30.81]I know you'll be standing by my side
[02:42.93]And I need to be close to you
[03:45.20]When Satan mocks and friends turn to foes
[03:50.78]It feels like everything is out to make me lose control
[04:05.82]Till I find my way home to you...to you
