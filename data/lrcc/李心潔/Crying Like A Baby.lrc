[00:22.16]
[00:22.56]阿媽躺在那張飄著木香味的芭哩上
[00:28.07]我就坐在她身旁
[00:31.70]看著她呼出最後一口氣
[00:35.40]眼角流下兩行淚
[00:40.51]我真的不知道人死了後會去哪裡
[00:44.74]但是我願意相信
[00:49.00]她就住在那個白色的天堂裡
[00:52.51]永遠都在我心裡
[00:54.30]
[01:03.99]I miss my AMA  I miss my AMA
[01:15.52]She is far far far away fram me
[01:26.63]She lives in the white white heaven
[01:32.04]I'm crying crying like a baby
[01:42.47]When I meet her in my dream
[01:48.46]
[01:51.33]I miss my papa I miss my papa
[02:03.50]He looked so fierce when I was a child
[02:13.71]But now he has become so kind and fragile
[02:19.69]He was crying crying like a baby
[02:30.08]When he set beside me and talk to me
[02:35.32]
[02:39.27]They always told me Life is not that difficult
[02:48.39]Trying to bebrave Just find your happiness
[02:58.61]Their love wilI never change Just like an angel
[03:09.34]Live in my heart forever forever forever
[03:24.42]
[03:48.79]I miss my mama I miss my mama
[04:00.38]She always smiles smiles like an angel
[04:10.26]Gave me power to face the challenge
[04:16.11]I'm crying crying like a baby
[04:25.85]When she holds me tightly in her arms
