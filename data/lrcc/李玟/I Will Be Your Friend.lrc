[00:01.00]I Will Be Your Friend
[00:08.00]CoCo Lee

[00:12.00]When every moment get too hard
[00:17.00]The end of the road can feel so far
[00:22.00]No matter how much time we're apart 
[00:28.00]I'm always near you
[00:32.00]I'll be the shelter in you rain
[00:38.00]Help you to find your smile
[00:43.00]I'll make you laugh at a broken heart
[00:49.00]Wherever you are

[02:29.00][01:56.00][00:53.00]'Cause I'm never gonna walk away
[02:53.00][02:32.00][01:58.00][00:55.00]If the walls come down some day
[02:55.00][02:34.00][02:01.00][00:58.00]All alone you feel afraid
[02:58.00][02:37.00][02:03.00][01:00.00]I'll be there when you call me name
[03:01.00][02:40.00][02:06.00][01:03.00]You can always depend on me
[03:03.00][02:42.00][02:08.00][01:05.00]I believe until forever ends
[03:08.00][02:47.00][02:14.00][01:11.00]I will be your friend
[03:13.00][01:17.00]I will be your friend

[01:25.00]So many people come and go
[01:31.00]But nothing can change the you I know
[01:36.00]You'll never be just a face in the crowd
[01:42.00]And time will show
[01:44.00]Through the seasons and the years
[01:49.00]I will always hold you dear
[01:54.00]Never you fear


[02:16.00]I'll be around 
[02:19.00]when every candle burns down low
[02:26.00]And I want you, and I want you to know
