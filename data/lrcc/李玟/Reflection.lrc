[00:03.00]Reflection 

[00:10.00]Look at me 
[00:13.00]You may think you see 
[00:15.00]Who I really am 
[00:18.00]But you'll never know me 
[00:20.00]Every day 
[00:23.00]It's as if I play a part 
[00:28.00]Now I see 
[00:31.00]If I wear a mask 
[00:33.00]I can fool the world 
[00:36.00]But I cannot fool my heart 

[00:43.00]Who is that girl I see 
[00:49.00]Staring straight back at me? 
[00:53.00]When will my reflection show 
[00:59.00]Who I am inside? 

[01:06.00]I am now 
[01:08.00]In a world where I 
[01:11.00]Have to hide my heart 
[01:13.00]And what I believe in 
[01:16.00]But somehow 
[01:18.00]I will show the world 
[01:21.00]What's inside my heart 
[01:23.00]And be loved for who I am 

[01:31.00]Who is that girl I see 
[01:36.00]Staring straight back at me? 
[01:41.00]Why is my reflection 
[01:45.00]Someone I don't know? 
[01:51.00]Must I pretend that I'm 
[01:56.00]Someone else for all time? 
[02:01.00]When will my reflection show 
[02:06.00]Who I am inside? 

[02:10.00]There's a heart that must be 
[02:14.00]Free to fly 
[02:19.00]That burns with a need to know 
[02:23.00]The reason why 

[02:29.00]Why must we all conceal 
[02:34.00]What we think, how we feel? 
[02:39.00]Must there be a secret me 
[02:43.00]I'm forced to hide? 
[02:48.00]I won't pretend that I'm 
[02:54.00]Someone else for all time 
[02:59.00]When will my reflection show 
[03:04.00]Who I am inside? 
[03:11.00]When will my reflection show 
[03:17.00]Who I am inside?
