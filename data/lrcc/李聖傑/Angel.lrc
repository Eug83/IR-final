[00:11.80]Spend all your time waiting
[00:15.98]for that second chance
[00:19.23]for a break that would make it okay
[00:24.53]there's always some reason
[00:27.83]to feel not good enough
[00:31.63]and it's hard at the end of the day
[00:36.56]I need some distraction
[00:40.15]oh beautiful release
[00:44.28]memorys seep through my veins
[00:48.90]let me be empty
[00:52.50]oh and weightless then maybe
[00:56.80]I'll find some peace tonight

[01:02.31]In the arms of the angel
[01:07.88]fly away from here
[01:14.01]from this dark cold hotel room
[01:20.10]and the endlessness that you fear
[01:26.83]you are pulled from the wreckage
[01:32.60]of your silent reverie
[01:38.91]you're in the arms of the angel
[01:45.28]may you find some comfort here

[02:02.21]So tired of the straight line
[02:07.22]and everywhere you turn
[02:10.33]there's vultures and thieves at your back
[02:15.88]the storm keeps on twisting
[02:18.92]keep on building the lies
[02:22.20]that you make up for all that you lack
[02:27.69]it don't make no difference
[02:31.66]escape one last time
[02:34.93]it's easier to believe
[02:39.63]in this sweet madness oh
[02:44.23]this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

[02:53.10]In the arms of the angel
[02:58.57]fly away from here
[03:04.89]from this dark cold hotel room
[03:11.01]and the endlessness that you fear
[03:17.54]you are pulled from the wreckage
[03:23.35]of your silent reverie
[03:29.75]you're in the arms of the angel
[03:36.09]may you find some comfort here
[03:48.23]you're in the arms of the angel
[03:54.74]may you find some comfort here
