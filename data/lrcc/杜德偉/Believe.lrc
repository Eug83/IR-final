[00:33.00]Now I'm off to see the wizard
[00:35.00]He who hold the key
[00:36.00]To give me answers to the questions I need
[00:38.00]He told me that I wasn't happy about the way of my world
[00:41.00]And I had to tend to say I agree

[00:44.00]Then he told me that you got to change your state of mind
[00:47.00]You got to start at the beginning leave all behind
[00:50.00]Take a new direction
[00:52.00]Believe in your decision
[00:53.00]And take it to the top and no one's gonna stop me

[03:15.00][02:05.00][01:09.00]And I couldn't careless if it kills me
[03:40.00][03:18.00][02:08.00][01:12.00]Give me room to express myself
[03:21.00][02:11.00][01:15.00]Just as long as I believe in me

[01:29.00]A pocket full of wishes and a world of dreams
[01:32.00]And I never seem to be complete
[01:34.00]I thought a woman could be all the angles for me
[01:37.00]But it turn out to be all deceit
[01:39.00]And you'll never never know for sure
[01:43.00]If people ever mean what they say
[01:46.00]When taking the chances you just have to realize
[01:49.00]Life is a gamble if you're doing it in your way
