[00:08.00]杜德偉

[00:18.00]Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
[00:25.00]Hand in hand you and I
[00:30.00]Let's cherish every moment we have been given
[00:35.00]The time is passing by
[00:40.00]I often pray before I lay down by your side
[00:50.00]If you receive your calling before I awake
[00:55.00]Could I make it through the night

[04:03.00][03:22.00][02:02.00][01:00.00]*cherish the love we have
[04:07.00][03:26.00][02:05.00][01:05.00]We should cherish the life we live
[04:13.00][03:32.00][02:10.00][01:11.00]Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
[03:42.00][02:22.00]Cherish the love we have
[03:47.00][02:26.00]For as long as we both shall live
[03:53.00][02:31.00]Cherish the love, cherish the life,
[03:58.00][02:37.00]Cherish the love*

[01:21.00]The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
[01:26.00]But love will stand the test of time
[01:31.00]The next life that we live in, remains to be seen
[01:36.00]Will you be by my side
[01:41.00]I often pray before I lay down by your side
[01:51.00]And if you receive your calling before I awake
[01:56.00]Could I make it through the night
