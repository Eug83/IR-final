[00:35.00]Used to be on my own
[00:38.00]Used to cry all alone
[00:42.00]Used to sit by the phone
[00:45.00]Waiting for love

[00:50.00]Dancing all by myself
[00:54.00]Wishing there's someone else
[00:57.00]I can share all my love
[01:00.00]Baby it's you

[03:41.00][02:37.00][01:33.00]Let's follow

[01:37.00]Every smile that you made
[01:41.00]Every look that you gave
[01:46.00]Girl I know that is you
[01:49.00]I've been dreaming of
