[01:44.00]I met a girl
[01:46.00]She said her name is Louisa
[01:48.00]She can get any man
[01:51.00]Whenever she pleases
[01:53.00]Got hot and heavy
[01:56.00]But the next thing I know
[01:59.00]She turn around and
[02:00.00]Say that I gotta go
[02:03.00]Now I'm left alone
[02:05.00]All by myself in the dark
[02:07.00]Light up all my fire before I fall apart

Repeat *#*#

I guess I should free my mind
And go with the flow
