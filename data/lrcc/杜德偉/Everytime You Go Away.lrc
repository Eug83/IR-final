[00:05.00]杜德偉

[00:24.00]Hey if we can solve any problems
[00:31.00]Why do we lose so many tears
[00:37.00]Oh I saw you go again
[00:43.00]When the leading man appears
[00:49.00]Always the same thing
[00:55.00]Can't you see we've got
[00:57.00]Everything going on and on and on

[03:57.00][03:33.00][03:10.00][02:11.00][01:01.00]Everytime you go away

[03:03.00][02:05.00]Cause (baby) can't you see We've got
[03:06.00][02:07.00]Everything baby even though you know
