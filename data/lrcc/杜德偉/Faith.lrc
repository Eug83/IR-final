[00:01.00]Faith

[00:03.00]杜德偉

[00:09.00]Well I guess it would be nice If I could touch your body
[00:14.00]I know not everybody has got a body like you
[00:19.00]But I've gotta think twice Before I give my heart away
[00:24.00]And I know all the games you play Because I play them too
[00:28.00]Oh but I need some time off from that emotion
[00:35.00]Time to pick my heart up off the floor
[00:39.00]Oh when that love comes down without devotion
[00:45.00]Well it takes a strong man baby
[00:47.00]But I'm showing you the door 'Cause I gotta have faith
[00:52.00]I gotta have faith because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
[00:56.00]I gotta have faith, faith, faith baby
[01:02.00]I know you're asking me to stay
[01:04.00]Say please, please, please, don't go away
[01:07.00]You say I'm giving you the blues maybe
[01:12.00]You mean every word you say
[01:14.00]Can't help but think of yesterday
[01:16.00]And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
[02:09.00][01:20.00]*Before this river becomes an ocean
[02:14.00][01:25.00]Before you throw my heart back on the floor
[02:18.00][01:29.00]Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion
[02:24.00][01:34.00]Well I need someone to hold me
[02:27.00][01:37.00]But I'll wait for something more*
[02:38.00][02:29.00][01:39.00]Yes I gotta have faith I gotta have faith
[02:43.00][02:34.00][01:44.00]because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
[02:46.00][02:36.00][01:46.00]I gotta have faith, faith, faith
