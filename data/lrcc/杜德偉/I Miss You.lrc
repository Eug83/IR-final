[00:02.00]I Miss You

[00:04.00]杜德偉

[00:26.00]Though I heard your voice yesterday
[00:33.00]Then I turned around to say, that I loved you, then I realize
[00:42.00]That it was just my mind playing tricks on me
[00:51.00]It seems colder lately at night
[00:58.00]And I try to sleep with the lights on
[01:03.00]Everytime the phone rings, I pray to God it's you
[01:10.00]I just can't believe, that we're through
[01:18.00]I miss you, (I miss you)
[01:24.00]There's no other way to say it (and I )
[01:29.00]And I can't deny it I miss you, (I miss you)
[01:36.00]It's so easy to see I miss you and me
[01:57.00]Is it done and over this time
[02:03.00]Have we really changed our minds
[02:07.00]'Bout each other's love
[02:11.00]all the feelings that we used to share
[02:15.00]I refuse to believe that you don't care
[02:22.00]I miss you, (I miss you)
[02:28.00]There's no other way to say it (and I )
[02:33.00]And I can't deny it I miss you, (I miss you)
[02:41.00]It's so easy to see
[02:45.00]I've got to gather my senses together
[02:55.00]I've been through worse kinds of weather
[03:01.00]If it's over now (over now), be strong (be strong)
[03:05.00]I can't believe that you're gone
[03:13.00]I've got to carry on but I miss you, (I miss you)
[03:21.00]It's driving me crazy I don't want to live without you
[03:28.00]I miss you, (I miss you) It's so easy to see
[03:37.00]I miss you and me
