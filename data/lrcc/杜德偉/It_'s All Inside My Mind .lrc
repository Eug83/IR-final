[00:01.00]It's All Inside My Mind

[00:04.00]杜德偉


[00:18.00]Is this the beginning of the end
[00:22.00]When two lovers can't be friends
[00:26.00]Now that I'm feeling so unsure I gotta know

[00:33.00]Tell me your love will always shine
[00:39.00]And I'm so wrong so wrong this time
[00:43.00]How do you make these feelings go I gotta know

[02:53.00][00:50.00]Then you hold me close
[02:55.00][00:52.00]And call my name Say to me
[02:59.00][00:55.00]That nothings changed
[03:01.00][00:58.00]And your hearts the same as its always been
[03:05.00][01:02.00]Then you make me understand its all inside

[04:00.00][03:44.00][03:27.00][02:21.00][02:05.00][01:07.00]Its all inside my mind
[04:03.00][03:46.00][03:30.00][02:24.00][02:08.00][01:10.00]I'll wake to find that I've been dreaming
[04:08.00][03:51.00][03:35.00][02:29.00][02:12.00][01:15.00]It's all inside my head
[04:12.00][03:54.00][03:38.00][02:32.00][02:16.00][01:18.00]Better listen to what my heart is feeling

[02:50.00][02:45.00][02:38.00]All inside all inside my mind
[02:41.00]All inside all inside my mind

[01:32.00]So just tell me I am wrong
[01:36.00]When I fell I don't belong
[01:40.00]And if I'm feeling insecure Don't let go

[01:47.00]Cause you don't give up when I'm down
[01:51.00]Give me time to come around
[01:55.00]Your hearts the same as its always been
[01:59.00]And you make me understand its all inside
