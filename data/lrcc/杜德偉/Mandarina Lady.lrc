[00:08.00]Just another night on the town
[00:13.00]Looking for some swinging old sound
[00:18.00]Mandarina Lady is the only club that I found
[00:26.00]People in the mood everywhere
[00:33.00]Magic I can feel in the air
[00:37.00]See if I can find some love for me at all

[00:47.00]Walk some lady
[00:49.00]Dress in a long silky gown
[00:55.00]She's something special
[00:58.00]Couldn't be from this side of town

[01:04.00]She's assigned man wants to see
[01:10.00]To my surprise she is looking at me
[01:14.00]Mandarina lady sweeps me off the ground

[01:30.00]I'll take you the way out

[01:52.00]Closer and closer we dance
[01:56.00]But no conversation no chance
[02:01.00]Mandarina lady can we talk at all
[02:09.00]Oh...can I hold you closer
[02:13.00]Tell you things that I like to say
[02:17.00]Well...she spoken in a whisper
[02:22.00]And taught me sing in this way
