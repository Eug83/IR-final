[00:02.00]No One Else Comes Close


[00:04.00]杜德偉


[00:18.00]When we turn out the lights
[00:22.00]The two of us alone together
[00:27.00]Something just not right
[00:31.00]But girl you know that I'd never
[00:36.00]ever let another's touch come between the two of us
[00:44.00]Cause no one else could never take your place

[02:51.00][02:15.00][00:52.00]No one else comes close to you
[02:55.00][02:19.00][00:57.00]No one makes me feel the way you do
[02:59.00][02:24.00][01:01.00]You're so special girl to me
[03:03.00][02:28.00][01:05.00]And you'll always be eternally
[03:08.00][02:33.00][01:10.00]Every time I hold you near
[03:12.00][02:37.00][01:14.00]You always say the words I love to hear
[03:17.00][02:42.00][01:18.00]Girl with just a touch you can do so much
[03:35.00][01:23.00]No one else come close

[01:41.00]And when I wake up to
[01:45.00]The touch of your head on my shoulder
[01:50.00]You're my dream come true
[01:55.00]Oh girl you know I'll always treasure
[01:59.00]Every kiss everyday love you girl in every way
[02:07.00]And I always will cause in my eyes
