[00:37.00]Whenever I get lonely
[00:41.00]I have a vision of you
[00:44.00]You made me feel so warm and cozy
[00:48.00]I don't know what to do
[00:51.00]So I call you every morning
[00:55.00]Just to hear you when you wake up
[00:59.00]And hope that we together be
[01:03.00]For all eternity

[01:07.00]Let me take you somewhere
[01:10.00]Far from all your troubles
[01:14.00]So I can hug you kiss you comfort you
[01:17.00]And hold you through night
[01:21.00]We can start a new beginning
[01:25.00]One that never has an ending
[01:29.00]Just the two
[01:31.00]Me and you
[01:33.00]Forever in a life

[04:34.00]Tell me
[04:37.00]What I have to do to keep you in my life
[04:45.00]I'll do it all for you

[02:22.00]Lately I've been feeling
[02:25.00]A sadness deep inside me
[02:29.00]But when I hold your body next to me
[02:33.00]The pain just goes away
[02:36.00]Cause the love we share between us
[02:40.00]Is the key to all our happiness
[02:44.00]Without a flaw, Spring or fall
[02:48.00]I'll love you through its all

[03:40.00]And you're feeling quite the same
[03:48.00]Girl I wanna hold you close to my heart
[03:56.00]Nothing can tear us apart
[04:00.00]Cause I'll be with you right there from the start
