[00:01.00]Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad

[00:05.00]杜德偉

[00:24.00]Baby we can talk all night
[00:30.00]But that ain't getting us nowhere
[00:38.00]I told you everything I possibly can
[00:44.00]There's nothing left inside of here
[00:49.00]And maybe you can cry all night
[00:55.00]But that'll never change the way that I feel
[01:03.00]The snow is really piling up outside
[01:09.00]I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
[01:16.00]I poured it on and I poured it out
[01:22.00]I tried to show you just how much I care
[01:29.00]I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
[01:34.00]But you've been cold to me so long
[01:40.00]I'm crying icicles instead of tears
[01:47.00]And all I can do is keep on telling you
[01:53.00]I want you, I need you
[01:59.00]But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
[02:06.00]Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad, cause two)
[02:13.00]Cause two out of three ain't bad
[02:19.00]Now don't be sad, Cause two out of three ain't bad
[02:41.00]You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
[02:47.00]You'll never drill for oil on a city street
[02:53.00]I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
[02:59.00]But there ain't no coupe de ville hiding
[03:04.00]At the bottom of a cracker jack box
[03:11.00]I can't lie I can't tell you that I'm something I'm not
[03:22.00]No matter how I try
[03:25.00]I'll never be able to give you something
[03:31.00]Something that I just haven't got
[03:38.00]There's only one girl that I will ever love
[03:43.00]And that was so many years ago
[03:48.00]And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
[03:56.00]She never loved me back, ooh I know
[04:02.00]I remember how she left me on a stormy night
[04:09.00]Oh she kissed me and got out of our bed
[04:15.00]And though I pleaded
[04:17.00]And I begged her not to walk out that door
[04:22.00]She packed her bags and turned right away
[04:28.00]And she kept on telling me, I want you, I need you
[04:43.00]But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
[04:50.00]Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad, cause two)
[04:57.00]Cause two out of three ain't bad
[05:02.00]Now don't be sad, Cause two out of three ain't bad
