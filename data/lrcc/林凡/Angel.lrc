[00:11.28]Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
[00:19.09]For a break that would make it OK
[00:23.03]There's always some reasons to feel not good enough
[00:31.12]And it's hard at the end of the day
[00:35.80]I need some distraction or a beautiful release
[00:45.97]Memories seep from my veins
[00:50.00]Let me be empty and weightless
[00:55.17]And maybe I'll find some peace tonight

[03:13.08][01:02.60]In the arms of the angel
[03:18.43][01:07.82]Fly away from here
[03:24.70][01:13.32]From this dark, cold hotel room
[03:30.17][01:20.09]And the endlessness that you fear
[03:35.73][01:25.13]You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
[03:48.84][01:36.43]In the arms of the angel
[03:55.84][01:45.13]May you find some comfort here

[02:21.40]So tired of the straight line
[02:25.64]And everywhere you turn
[02:29.92]There're vultures and thieves at your back
[02:33.64]The storm keeps on twisting
[02:36.47]You keep on building the lies
[02:40.75]That you make up for all that you lack
[02:46.06]It don't make no difference, escape one last time
[02:54.08]It's easier to believe
[02:58.65]In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
[03:06.76]That brings me to my knees

[04:08.30]In the arms of the angel
[04:14.20]May you find some comfort here
