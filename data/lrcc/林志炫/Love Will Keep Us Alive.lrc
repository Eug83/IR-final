[00:22.10]I was standing All alone against the world outside.
[00:31.65] You were search for a place to hide
[00:41.17]Lost and lonely
[00:44.61] Now you've given me the will to survive.
[00:50.84] When we're hungry .....love will keep us alive
[01:00.65]Don't you worry Sometimes you've just gotta let it ride.
[01:09.82]The world is changing
[01:14.11]Right before your eyes
[01:19.79]Now I've found you
[01:23.10]There's no more emptiness inside .
[01:29.02]When we're hungry...love will keep us alive
[01:38.60]I would die for you
[01:44.26] Climb the highest mountain
[01:49.27] Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
[01:57.65]Now I've found you
[02:01.83] There's no more emptiness inside .
[02:07.20] When we're hungry...love will keep us alive

[02:36.79]I would die for you
[02:42.03] Climb the highest mountain
[02:47.13] Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
[02:55.85]I was standing All alone against the world outside.
[03:05.15] You were search for a place to hide
[03:14.69]Lost and lonely
[03:18.28] Now you've given me the will to survive.
[03:24.56][03:34.18][03:43.69] When we're hungry .....love will keep us alive
