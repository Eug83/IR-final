[00:19.16]There's a hero
[00:23.39]If you look inside your heart
[00:27.28]You don't have to be afraid of what you are
[00:34.33]There's an answer
[00:38.60]If you reach into your soul
[00:42.24]And the sorrow that you know will melt away
[00:51.48]And then a hero comes along
[00:55.60]With the strength to carry on
[00:59.46]And you cast your fears aside
[01:03.23]And you know you can survive
[01:06.90]So when you feel like hope is gone
[01:10.82]Look inside you and be strong
[01:14.63]And you'll finally see the truth
[01:18.46]That a hero lies in you
[01:22.71]
[01:27.59]It's a long road
[01:31.60]When you face the world alone
[01:35.47]No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
[01:42.93]You can find love
[01:46.78]if you search within yourself
[01:50.64]And the emptiness you felt will disappear
[01:58.12]
[02:00.10]And then a hero comes along
[02:03.78]With the strength to carry on
[02:07.61]And you cast your fears aside
[02:11.46]And you know you can survive
[02:15.11]So when you feel like hope is gone
[02:18.68]Look inside you and be strong
[02:22.73]And you'll finally see the truth
[02:26.61]That a hero lies in you
[02:31.57]
[02:34.28]Lord knows
[02:37.88]Dreams are hard to follow
[02:41.68]But don't let anyone tear them away
[02:49.17]Hold on
[02:53.07]There will be tomorrow
[02:56.91]In time you'll find the way

[03:05.19]And then a hero comes along
[03:08.81]With the strength to carry on
[03:12.60]And you cast your fears aside
[03:16.49]And you know you can survive
[03:20.29]So when you feel like hope is gone
[03:23.77]Look inside you and be strong
[03:27.81]And you'll finally see the truth
[03:31.52]That a hero lies in you
[03:38.86]That a hero lies in you
[03:49.79]
[03:53.83]That a hero lies in you
