[00:00.00]I STILL BELIEVE  林憶蓮
[00:04.36]愛上一個不回家的人(百佳051)
[00:08.52]
[00:14.09]You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside.
[00:23.51]I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart.
[00:31.82]And after all this time you'd think that I,
[00:36.37]I wouldn't feel the same but time melts into nothing and nothing's changed.

[04:32.80][03:59.66][03:24.43][01:24.32]I still believe someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.
[04:49.22][04:16.15][03:40.74][01:40.91]I had a dream someday you and me will find ourselves in love again.

[01:59.56][00:49.27]Each day of my life I'm filled with all the joy I could find.
[02:09.65][00:59.07]You know that I am not the desparate type.
[02:16.82][01:06.90]If there's one spark of hope left in my grasp I hold it with both hands.
[02:25.09][01:14.74]It's worth the risk of burning to have a second chance.
