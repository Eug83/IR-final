[00:48.35]She's faced the hardest times you cound imagine
[00:58.02]And many times her eyes fought back the tears

[01:16.97]Each time her slonder shoulders 
[01:20.84]bore the weight of all her fears
[01:25.08]And a sorrow no one hears 
[01:29.14]till rings in mid-night silence in her ears

[03:08.43]growing wild
[03:16.24]
[02:47.20]a free and gentle flower growing wild
