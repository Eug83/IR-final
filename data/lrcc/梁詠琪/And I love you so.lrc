[00:06.00]*希望能和您成為朋友*
[00:08.00]主唱：梁詠琪
   
[00:12.00]And I love you so.
[00:19.00]The people ask me how. 
[00:24.00]How I've lived till now.
[00:30.00] I tell them I don't know.
[00:36.00]I guess they understand.
[00:42.00] How lonely life has been.
[00:48.00]But life began again. 
[00:53.00]The day you took my hand.

[02:37.00][01:01.00]And yes I know.
[02:43.00][01:06.00] How lonely(loveless)life can be. 
[02:49.00][01:12.00]The shadows follow me.
[02:54.00][01:18.00] And the night won't set me free.
[03:00.00][01:24.00]But I don't let the evening.
[03:05.00][01:30.00]Get(Bring)me down.
[03:11.00][01:36.00] Now that you're around~ me. 

[01:48.00]And you love me too.
[01:55.00] Your thoughts are just for me.
[02:00.00]You set my spirit free. I'm happy that you do.
[02:11.00]The book of life is brief. And once a page is read.
[02:24.00]All but love is dead that is my belief.

[03:25.00]And I love you so. The people ask me how.
[03:37.00]How i've lived till now. I tell them I don't know. 
[03:48.00]
