[00:14.61]Tell me where to begin.
[00:20.39]How did I get so empty within?
[00:25.99]What's the use withour you in my life?
[00:30.95]I wish that we could start at thebeginning.
[00:37.13]Just a moment in time
[00:42.88]How could I be so blind and so cold.
[00:48.69]Girl, you gave me the wisdom to see.
[00:53.75]You're everything my heart and soulneeds.
[01:00.87]Sometimes the heart is the last one to grow.
[01:14.06]I just the way that I feel.
[01:17.59]And I promise, I'll let her know.
[01:46.59]I hear your voice in the night.
[01:52.48]Tell me true everything's alright.
[01:57.91]Suddenly I awake from my dream.
[02:02.98]And mow I know exactly what love means.
[02:31.76]One bad mistake, is what it takes.
[02:36.94]A sign that loves in the making.
[02:42.60]I stop pretending, our love needs;mending.
[02:48.42]I'll know that next time to be careful.
