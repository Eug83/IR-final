[00:27.00]In the town where I was born
[00:30.00]Lived a man who sailed to sea
[00:34.00]And he told us of his life
[00:38.00]In the land submarines
[00:42.00]So we sailed up to the sun
[00:45.00]Till we found the sea of green
[00:49.00]And we lived beneath the waves
[00:53.00]In our yellow submarine
[00:57.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[01:01.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[01:05.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[01:08.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[01:12.00]And our friends are all on board
[01:15.00]Many more of them live next door
[01:19.00]And the band begins to play
[01:27.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[01:31.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[01:35.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[01:39.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[01:57.00]as we live a life of ease
[02:01.00]Everyone of us has all we need
[02:05.00]Sky of blue and sea of green
[02:08.00]In our yellow submarine
[02:13.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[02:16.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[02:20.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[02:24.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[02:28.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[02:31.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[02:35.00]We all live in our yellow submarine
[02:39.00]Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
[02:41.00]
[02:43.00]BEYOND再見理想
