[00:04.56]I watched you sleep as you lay there
[00:11.69]I dropped to my knees and said a prayer
[00:20.32]I leaned over softly to kiss your beautiful face
[00:29.16]But I could not cross the ocean of your grace
[00:38.81]The moonlight held you a loft a picture of peace
[00:47.92]The only sound was the soft breeze form the east
[00:56.41]My heart beat down in my chest To the rhythm of your gentle breath
[01:05.61]And the whole world calmed down
[01:11.23]For this moment of rest
[01:18.88]Now I'm….I'm standing above you trying so hard no To tell you I love you
[01:29.17]And all that I want in this world is you
[01:36.51]If you'd only wake up
[01:40.30]You'd know I was true
[01:58.45]Oh baby
[02:00.32]I love you can be so hard to say
[02:08.16]Especially when it's meant in this strong a way
[02:16.53]But at this moment while you lie sleep
[02:20.19]I am suddenly free
[02:25.79]And my trembling arms reach out for you
[02:31.75]As if you could see
[02:39.48]Now I'm ….I'm standing above you trying so hard not to tell you I love you
[02:49.75]And all that I want in this world is you
[02:56.82]If you'd only wake up
[03:00.82]you'd know it was true
[03:05.94]If you'd only wake up
[03:10.16]you'd know it was true
