[00:41.80]
[00:46.80]I'm about to go off like a gunshot
[00:49.71]
[00:52.34]I wanna make you drip like a sweatshop
[00:55.27]
[00:57.79]I'm about to make sounds that you never heard
[01:00.70]
[01:03.17]Yeah I wanna take your locks
[01:04.88]And break'em with the keys in your hand
[01:07.09]And a microphone in mine

[03:34.21][03:12.28][01:58.72][01:08.84]Man it makes me high (It makes me high)
[03:39.63][03:17.57][02:04.09][01:14.38]Lifts me to the sky (Yeah, yeah)
[03:45.00][03:23.13][02:09.62][01:19.79]Love is just a lie (It's just a lie)
[03:50.71][03:28.73][02:15.17][01:25.51]What made me so high (What made me so)
[03:56.44][02:20.97][01:30.94]
[01:36.61]I have got to admit
[01:37.93]This Homeboy, he won't quit
[01:39.22]Makin' beats, talkin' shit
[01:40.55]Spittin' fast, keepin' it
[01:42.23]Session file, twenty-four bit
[01:43.36]On the stage, is where I'm lit
[01:44.84]All my fans, freakin' it
[01:46.07]Jumpin' around, 'cause they won't sit
[01:47.38]I'm talkin' 'bout body surfin'
[01:50.75]Hands wavin', botties jerkin'
[01:52.26]Some may dabble in the fountain
[01:53.56]Of funk but as for us
[01:55.03]We're already swimming in it
[01:57.14]
