[00:47.42]Nature is forever
[00:53.16]The home for all mankind
[00:59.61]And nature is emotion
[01:05.88]That makes you fell alive
[01:12.18]And time will pass
[01:15.26]And you at last will live life all too fast
[01:24.69]So slow the pace
[01:27.71]And lift you face
[01:31.07]And heaven will remind you
[01:40.52]That nature is reason
[01:46.75]That everything is fine
[01:52.86]But nature needs attention
[01:59.25]We're running out of time
[02:05.50]And soon you'll learn that's your turn
[02:11.91]To take her back to you
[02:18.07]The change must come
[02:21.31]One by one
[02:24.35]It has to start with you
[02:58.98]And time will pass
[03:02.05]And you at last
[03:05.16]Will life all too fast
[03:11.32]So slow the pace
[03:14.46]And lift your face
[03:17.96]And heaven will remind you
[03:35.40]Nature is forever
[03:40.83]The home for all mankind
[03:47.29]Nature is believing
[03:53.15]Our dreams will never die
[03:59.60]We laugh and cry
[04:02.62]We live our lives
[04:05.81]And never realize
[04:12.07]We think we know
[04:15.16]But even so
[04:18.39]Life around us dies
[04:27.39]Don't let it die
[04:33.77]You can't let it die
[04:41.12]And I say pleas don't let it die
