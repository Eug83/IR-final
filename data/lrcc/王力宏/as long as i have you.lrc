[00:12.00]Everything that you are
[00:18.00]And everything that you do
[00:24.00]Fills me with hope and love
[00:30.00]I want you to know that I love you
[00:36.00]Thoughts of you fill my mind
[00:41.00]And brighten up every day
[00:47.00]My dreams of a perfect love
[00:54.00]Coming true in so many ways
[01:02.00]And I know I can't be wrong
[01:07.00]To say that together we belong
[01:12.00]And think of the times
[01:16.00]We've seen each other through
[01:26.00]Tell me if the song
[01:30.00]Should ever get weary or too long
[01:36.00]That everyghing will calm
[01:40.00] As long as I have you
[02:11.00]
[02:14.00]Your kisses are just like sumshine
[02:20.00]Melting away the winter snow and
[02:26.00]Suddenly life awakens
[02:32.00]Reminding me you're the best woman I know
[02:36.00]And I know I can't be wrong
[02:43.00]To say that together we belong
[02:48.00]And think of the times
[02:52.00]We've seen each other through
[03:02.00]Tell me if the song
[03:06.00]Should ever get weary or too long
[03:12.00]That everyghing will calm
[03:17.00] As long as I have you
[03:27.00]Tell me if the song
[03:31.00]Should ever get weary or too long
[03:37.00]That everyghing will calm
[03:40.00] As long as I have you
