[00:18.42]You told me one misty day and never go away
[00:24.82]The look in your eyes I'm so afraid
[00:31.22]Deep in a spell feels like a spinning carousel
[00:37.90]Are they just kisses in the wind
[00:41.10]
[00:43.78]One day in the morming rain you came back (to) ease my pain
[00:50.01]Will our hearts ever be the same?
[00:56.42]Make believing there were no broken promises
[01:02.58]But they're just kisses in the wind
[01:05.81]
[02:26.52][01:07.60]And the sun won't ever shine I guess it don't mind
[02:34.06][01:15.20]Now that you're gone but I will always love you
[01:21.35]Who stop the rain is me to blame
[02:40.16]Who stop the rain is me(is me)to blame
[02:46.76][01:27.98]Broken records and picture frames
[02:50.56][01:31.50]
[01:37.25]The sun setting to the west
[01:40.21]I'm feeling the emptiness
[01:43.60]Or are you saving it all the best
[01:49.62]Pour out my heart then say we should be (far) apart
[01:56.13]And they're just kisses in the wind
[01:59.43]
[02:56.07]The in them brises here say goodbye I don't wanna cry yet
[03:01.51]One must kiss my lone one every die
[03:08.68]I'm before my ever aim being love for you
[03:15.00]To you is just kisses in the wind
[03:18.49]
