[00:24.73]Whenever sang my songs
[00:30.76]On the stage, on my own
[00:35.77]Whenever said my words
[00:41.35]Wishing they would be heard
[00:46.27]I saw you smiling at me
[00:51.24]Was it real or just my fantasy
[00:57.06]You'd always be there in the corner
[01:03.46]Of this tiny little bar
[01:07.46]
[01:07.96]My last night here for you
[01:12.62]Same old songs, just once more
[01:18.06]My last night here with you
[01:23.61]Maybe yes, maybe no
[01:28.81]I kind of liked it your way
[01:33.64]How you shyly placed your eyes on me
[01:39.85]Oh, did you ever know
[01:44.06]That I had mine on you
[01:46.26]
[01:51.71]Darling, so there you are
[01:56.36]With that look on your face
[02:02.58]As if you're never hurt
[02:07.39]As if you're never down
[02:12.35]Shall I be the one for you
[02:18.11]Who pinches you softly but sure
[02:24.38]If frown is shown then
[02:27.92]I will know that you're no dreamer
[02:30.82]
[03:01.68]So let me come to you
[03:07.19]Close as I wanna be
[03:12.57]Close enough for me
[03:17.46]To feel your heart beating fast
[03:23.20]And stay there as I whisper
[03:27.63]How I love you peaceful eyes on me
[03:33.84]Did you ever know
[03:38.24]That I had mine on you
[03:41.00]
[03:45.68]Darling, so share with me
[03:50.54]Your love if you have enough
[03:56.26]Your tears if you're holding back
[04:01.10]Or pain if that's what it is
[04:06.89]How can I let you know
[04:11.85]I'm more than the dress and the voice
[04:18.51]Just reach me out then
[04:21.33]You will know that you're not dreaming
[04:25.90]
[04:28.57]Darling, so there you are
[04:33.91]With that look on your face
[04:39.53]As if you're never hurt
[04:44.54]As if you're never down
[04:49.34]Shall I be the one for you
[04:56.47]Who pinches you softly but sure
[05:02.49]If frown is shown then
[05:04.12]I will know that you're no dreamer
