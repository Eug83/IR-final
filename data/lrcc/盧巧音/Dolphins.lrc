[04:38.15][02:38.03][01:11.63][00:06.09]
[00:15.20]Last night i went to you shore
[00:21.54]Wanting to see your face
[00:28.38]Last night i dreamt of your touch
[00:34.07]Hoping to hear your voice
[00:41.36]I do admit.But i don't believe
[00:48.26]The life of you will show me a sign
[00:55.94]Come back to me.I said come bace to me
[01:02.80]I just want to see your mind
[01:39.59]Tonight I shout from the rain and the storm
[01:46.72]Just want a word with you
[01:54.00]But no one comes to wipe away my tears
[02:00.80]Nothing comforts me
[02:07.80]I lefe behind.Cos'l feel you inside
[02:14.59]The more you know.The sorrow will grow
[02:22.07]Oh,you.You just flow and flow.
[02:28.38]In the sea of selfishness of lies
[03:27.21]I've been waiting for the day that comes
[03:34.56]Your colour of pink.Your smile that swings
[03:40.69]Close your eyes.till the end of the time
[03:47.82]I know you're desperated by the hidden lies
[03:54.55]I do admit.But I don't believe
[04:01.92]The life of you will show me a sign
[04:08.98]Far from above and deep inside
[04:15.52]Oh,Jesus.Please bring them back
[04:21.77]Bring them back.Bring them back
