[00:00.49]盧巧音 - Dream
[01:20.43][00:04.68]
[00:08.67]I fell asleep last night When the room was dark
[00:15.18]The moon was shining blue I had a dream with you
[00:21.11]You walk side by side with me
[00:23.89]And I want to hold your hand
[00:25.42]And I can feel your warmth Everything seems true
[00:32.25]Nothing's really gonna blue Nothing bothers you
[00:36.25]You can see it from my eyes wanting you
[00:47.46]You are sad and you cry You just live at night
[00:51.16]We only meet at night Love is pain we find
[00:57.65]It's true I do confess
[01:00.75]We'll never have our days There's no eternal life
[01:03.91]But the moon still keeps on shining
[01:09.33]Nothing's really gonna blue Nothing bothers you
[01:13.38]You can see it from my eyes wanting you
[01:53.68]I don't want to live a black way
[01:57.02]I don't want to hate
[02:00.39]I don't want to live a black way
[02:04.14]I don't want to hate
[02:07.85]I don't want to live a black way
[02:11.70]I don't want to live day by day
[02:15.48]I don't want to live a black way
[02:18.99]I don't want to live day by day
[02:22.86]I don't want to hate
[02:26.54]I don't want to hate
[02:30.07]I don't want to hate
[02:34.23]I don't
