[00:00.00]米倉千尋 - I Saw The Light
[00:04.37]原唱：Todd Rundgren
[00:06.37]
[00:08.37]It was late last night
[00:13.73]I was feeling something wasn't right
[00:19.06]There was not another soul in sight
[00:24.52]Only you
[00:28.87]
[00:33.40]So we walked along,
[00:37.59]Though I knew there was something wrong
[00:41.59]And the feeling hit me oh so strong about you
[00:49.63]Then you gazed up at me
[00:53.68]And the answer was plain to see
[00:57.79]'Cause I saw the light in your eyes
[01:05.82]In your eyes
[01:09.62]Though we had our fling
[01:13.75]I just never would suspect a thing
[01:17.72]'Til that little bell began to ring in my head
[01:23.86]In my head
[01:25.75]But I tried to run,
[01:29.71]Though I knew it wouldn't help me none
[01:33.65]'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
[01:39.77]I said
[01:41.76]But my feelings for you
[01:45.84]Were just something I never knew
[01:49.81]'Til I saw the light in your eyes
[01:57.94]In your eyes
[02:03.81]
[02:13.83]In your eyes
[02:17.95]But I love you best
[02:22.13]It's not something that I say in jest
[02:26.05]'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
[02:29.75]In my eyes
[02:32.25]In my eyes
[02:34.10]And I ran out before
[02:37.94]But I won't do it anymore
[02:42.03]Can't you see the light in my eyes
[02:50.04]In my eyes...
