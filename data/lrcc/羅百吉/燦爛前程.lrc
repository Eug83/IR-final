[00:03.00]歌詞吾愛http://lovelrc.yes8.com
[00:06.00]Once upon a time there was three lost kids
[00:08.00]They try to learn about life in the street all night
[00:11.00]One guy got shot and the other got hooked on
[00:14.00]drugs they thought once were so good
[00:16.00]Now there's only one guy left in the sane
[00:19.00]Trying to do good and give a brother a hand
[00:21.00]If you want it let me know
[00:27.00]If my heart there's a place for you
[00:32.00]If you want it let me know
[00:37.00]If my heart there's a place for you
[00:42.00]people always see the bad things in life
[00:44.00]Just like me it took a long time to fight
[00:47.00]To fight the enemy deep deep inside
[00:49.00]If you conquer your heart you can conquer the world
[02:22.00][01:42.00][00:52.00]* The future a place for us to be
[02:24.00][01:44.00][00:54.00]I see the future just you and me
[02:27.00][01:46.00][00:57.00]I see the future a place for us to be
[02:29.00][01:49.00][00:59.00]I see the future
[02:52.00][02:32.00][01:53.00][01:02.00]If you want it let me know
[02:57.00][02:37.00][01:57.00][01:07.00]In my heart there's a place for you
[02:42.00][02:02.00][01:12.00]If you want it let me know
[02:47.00][02:07.00][01:17.00]In my heart there's a place for you
[01:32.00]I've always been around here to help
[01:34.00]To help people that think they hate themselves
[01:37.00]Cause I was like that until l face my crime
[01:39.00]So if you put the past behind then the future is yours Repeat *
[02:13.00]Now stop blame yourself for things youlve done before
[02:16.00]You'me got to learn to forgive yourself and move on
