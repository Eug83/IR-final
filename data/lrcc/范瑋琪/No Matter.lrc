[00:10.22]A smile upon your face
[00:11.85]And feathers dance in grace
[00:16.23]Your thousand kisses
[00:17.51]This is our time and space
[00:20.35]Forever has no pace
[00:24.89]What if this is
[00:26.95]A moment and a place
[00:28.92]For lovers in a haste?
[00:33.33]See what bliss is
[00:35.55]If this is all we have
[00:37.45]Tomorrow we must go
[00:41.30]You should know

[03:01.64][01:52.50][00:43.99]I don』t care at all
[03:04.42][01:54.59][00:47.20]wherever you want to go
[03:06.80][01:58.27][00:49.64]I』ll feel at home
[03:08.71][02:00.27][00:51.70]No matter through the rise or fall
[03:13.77][02:05.20][00:56.33]Through every bend
[03:15.55][02:06.97][00:58.33]Until the end
[03:17.47][02:08.99][01:00.28]Cause darling, I don』t care at all
[03:21.49][02:13.27][01:04.30]Whatever life has in store
[03:23.73][02:15.47][01:06.86]I』ll ask no more
[03:25.89][02:17.36][01:08.83]No matter how tomorrow calls
[03:30.41][02:21.96][01:13.60]Time made a vow
[03:32.64][02:23.89][01:15.58]Forever now

[01:17.67]Fire-flies in the air
[01:20.20]The fever drawing near
[01:24.86]Before the love strikes
[01:27.14]Someone has lit the stars
[01:28.85]And shadows mold the scars
[01:31.83]In the moonlight
[01:35.38]But only here we are
[01:37.33]Unbroken driven far
[01:41.93]From the first time
[01:43.81]IF this is all we have
[01:45.97]Tomorrow we must go

[02:26.00]When we awake to the morning and break
[02:30.36]The moment, then repent
[02:34.91]And then confused, feeling, something』s been bruised
[02:38.97]We must go, but you』ll know
