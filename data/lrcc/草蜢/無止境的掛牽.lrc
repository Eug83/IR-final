[00:02.00]<無止境的掛牽>
[00:04.00]曲：蘇志威
[00:06.00]詞：李敏
[00:08.00]專輯:《三人主義》
[00:10.00]
[00:12.14]開始掛牽
[00:15.50]誰令我深夜也未眠
[00:18.89]不感到疲倦
[00:20.41]是腦海的印像盤旋
[00:25.64]一堆照片
[00:28.93]呈現我心上似蜜甜
[00:32.35]全是你俏臉
[00:34.68]促使我未入眠
[00:36.82]也想得太遠

[02:15.80][00:41.19]明瞭時鐘的針不可倒轉
[02:18.81][00:44.59]方等到清早飄過身邊
[02:22.26][00:48.06]仍無眠我怕繼續想你
[02:25.62][00:51.66]這概念永遠也未完

[03:21.24][02:33.00][00:58.65]無止境地掛牽
[03:23.88][02:35.80][01:01.49]想分分秒秒也可見
[03:27.28][02:39.33][01:05.18]存在是你最美麗笑面
[03:31.09][02:43.00][01:08.65]令人日夜望不厭
[03:34.35][02:46.36][01:12.08]由想識的那天
[03:37.42][02:49.45][01:15.13]便開始發覺我在變
[03:41.02][01:18.71]我心反側輾轉
[03:43.33][01:21.18]相戀中變熱暖
[01:25.95]
[02:53.05]流露在我臉上
[02:55.48]快樂繼續擴展
[02:59.51]
[01:46.52]今天太短
[01:49.42]明日再相聚再續延
[01:52.98]想得太凌亂
[01:55.20]在記憶中繼續纏綿
[01:59.80]應該制止
[02:03.23]停住了思念去入眠
[02:06.68]停住那片段
[02:09.00]必需找到底線
[02:11.08]愛戀不會斷
[03:49.65]Ba La La....
[03:56.42]Hey, still remember how we met
[04:00.72]Well, it was just a day
[04:04.26]like any ordinary day
[04:06.18]I was standing under a shade waiting for you
[04:11.64]it was raining too. Yeah, I remember
[04:17.33]just when I was about to turn away
[04:20.83]There you are, huh! Standing in front of me
[04:26.29]I can still remember that smile on your face
[04:29.73]That look in your eyes
[04:31.67]that moment everything doesn't seem to matter
[04:36.41]anymore I just have to close my eyes
[04:40.92]then I can still feel the warmth of your sweet smile
