[00:22.85]When you're weary,feeling small,
[00:32.23]When tears are in your eyes,
[00:38.93]I will dry them all
[00:45.47]I'm on your side.
[00:49.56]When times get rough
[00:56.43]And friends just can't be found
[02:23.47][01:02.49]Like a bridge over troubled water
[02:30.91][01:09.85]I will lay me down.
[01:12.73]Like a bridge over troubled water
[01:18.82]I will lay me down.
[01:33.53]When you are down and out
[01:38.29]When you're on the street,
[01:42.59]When evening falls so hard
[01:49.38]I will comfort you.
[01:54.52]I take your part
[02:02.85]When the darkness comes
[02:06.81]And pain is all around.
[02:12.43]Like a bridge over troubled water
[02:19.04]I will lay me down.
[03:06.19]Sail on silvergirl,Sail on by,
[03:14.05]Your time has come to shine.
[03:21.05]All your dreams are on their way
[03:27.60]See how they shine.
[03:34.58]If you need a friend.
[03:38.55]I'm sailing right behind.
[03:44.29]Like a bridge over troubled water
[03:51.76]I will lay me down.
[03:55.23]Like a bridge over troubled water
[04:02.41]I will lay me down.
[04:07.15]Yes I'll,yes I'll Lay me down.
