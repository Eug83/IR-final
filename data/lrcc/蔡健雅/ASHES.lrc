[00:10.85]I looked around for life
[00:15.22]For something to hold me back in time
[00:20.81]Yearning, waiting to
[00:25.55]Break into the silence of the night
[00:39.19]A thousand troubled lies
[00:43.73]Trapped within truth and confusion
[00:49.67]Forgive me
[00:53.56]Maybe for the words I chose to say
[01:52.32][00:58.36]If I should fall
[01:54.45][01:00.56]Into your arms
[01:58.35][01:03.11]Would I feel insecure
[02:01.23][01:07.23]Im so far away
[02:03.32][01:09.42]But too close so you say
[02:05.94][01:12.08]Funny why we make peace and love
[02:10.23][01:16.93]Once again theres nothing to feel
[01:32.87]Im sheltered from the light
[01:37.37]Hiding behind this shady vision
[01:43.22]Holding the wind
[01:47.47]I hate to think that you wont be there anymore
[02:14.85]Im in love with you in every waking hour
[02:19.09]Every now and then you move me
[02:23.47]Im in love with you in every waking hour
[02:28.38]All the ashes in my eyes
[02:41.50]Dont you know that I love you I love you
[02:47.10]And I want to
[02:50.32]So if you are thinking of running away
[02:54.85]Let me run with you
