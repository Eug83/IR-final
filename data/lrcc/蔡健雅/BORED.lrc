[00:16.98]Faking a smile I was talking to you
[00:20.13]Did you know I was tired of feeling the blue
[00:23.72]So I thought of the sun
[00:25.66]And I thought of the rain
[00:28.00]Thought of the weather what its doing today
[00:32.64]If it fine fine fine
[00:35.91]Making a scene for the people to see
[00:39.14]Did you know you were boring the hell out of me
[00:42.70]So I thought of the sun
[00:44.62]And I thought of the rain
[00:47.13]Thought of the weather what its doing today
[00:50.45]Will it shine shine shine
[02:35.17][02:03.24][00:54.27]I wanna sit around waiting for nothing
[02:37.51][02:06.87][00:57.97]I wanna walk around feeling down
[02:41.29][02:10.51][01:01.83]I wanna get that silly high on cigarettes
[02:45.04][02:14.56][01:05.70]I wanna spin about round and round
[02:51.04][02:22.67][01:13.23]Du du du du du
[03:07.88]High high  high
[01:37.48]Du du du du du
[02:31.86]round and round
