[00:21.77]Drunk on my sobriety
[00:27.04]Driven by your insanity
[00:31.85]Made to stumble in my formative years
[00:36.84]Could have sworn it was my perversion
[00:42.19]Care to spare me a minute
[00:47.22]Could i be alone for awhile
[00:52.07]Fortunately you were out of my way
[00:56.98]Could have sworn it was my possession
[01:01.69]Until next time
[01:06.39]Until next life
[01:12.92]Never knew youd hurt me
[01:17.94]Now you crave for sincerity
[01:22.92]Thought we d be around for twenty long years
[01:27.81]So its just imagination
[01:33.13]Was it bad now really
[01:38.10]When the sex has lost all its charm
[01:43.13]Whos to blame for putting up with the fight
[01:48.02]So its just to my elation
[01:52.77]Until next time
[01:57.58]Until next life
[02:43.65][02:02.54]I ll wear my clothes right
[02:48.64][02:08.57]I ll sleep on the other side
[02:52.09][02:13.10]I ll say whats necessary
[02:58.86][02:18.35]Until next time
