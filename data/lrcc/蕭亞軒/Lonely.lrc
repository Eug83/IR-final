[00:00.00]Lonely
[00:05.00]By Ansen Yu
[00:10.77]Lighting streaks and thunder rules my heart
[00:15.68]Raging storms and oceans tear us apart
[00:21.81]My dear, you are not here

[00:30.42]Something strange has gotton over me
[00:35.06]I get the feeling that I lived beneath your skin
[00:41.51]Come and walk with me

[00:48.29]Lonely in my heart, heaven falls as I reach for the sky
[00:53.53]Caught in a spell of this heartache for a million nights
[00:58.45]So lay me out in the moon-light, let me breathe
[01:03.51]Your lovely name in my window pane to bring me relief
[01:08.31]The pouring rain at my door-step is saying to me
[01:13.05]Oh where, on where, shall I place my thoughts to make me complete?
[01:18.21]Forevermore inside our dreams we's always be
[01:28.17]Oh......Oh baby, Oh......

[01:47.83]Lonely in my heart, heaven falls as I reach for the sky
[01:52.94]Caught in a spell of this heartache for a million nights
[01:57.80]So lay me out in the moon-light, let me breathe
[02:03.03]Your lovely name in my window pane to bring me relief
[02:07.86]The flowing tears from my eyes will never put out this flame
[02:12.68]Eternally rising up and driving me insane
[02:17.66]You are the air, keeps it burning, all in vain
[02:22.53]The show is over, we will never be the same

[02:27.37]Lonely in my heart, heaven falls as I reach for the sky
[02:32.39]Caught in a spell of this heartache for a million nights
[02:37.21]So lay me out in the moon-light, let me breathe
[02:42.33]Your lovely name in my window pane to bring me relief
[02:47.22]The pouring rain at my door-step is saying to me......oh
[02:58.29]Forevermore inside our dreams we'd always be......oh
