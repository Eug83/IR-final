[00:00.00]Never Look Back
[00:05.00]By Ansen Yu
[00:22.58]See the tear in your eyes
[00:24.90]Let it fall from the sky
[00:27.26]Meet the rainbow as it comes behind

[00:31.57]There's a vision for you
[00:33.87]That you're not letting through
[00:36.28]Time for letting go that state of mind

[02:10.68][00:40.02]It's better to love and to lose, so they say
[02:15.24][00:44.69]Than never have loved at all
[02:19.62][00:48.99]So don't hang around feeling sad, looking down
[02:24.07][00:53.58]It's a lesson, you might as well learn

[03:22.22][02:45.97][02:27.78][01:15.39][00:57.18]C'est la vie
[03:24.27][02:48.00][02:29.80][01:17.33][00:59.11]You give and you get, you live and you let
[03:28.65][02:52.52][02:34.20][01:22.01][01:03.77]No-one said it was easy
[03:31.23][02:55.03][02:36.77][01:24.29][01:06.32]Et d'amour
[03:33.24][02:57.05][02:38.84][01:26.36][01:08.45]You never look back, never ever regret
[03:37.55][03:01.51][02:43.32][01:30.86][01:12.92]Letting go it's not easy

[01:53.14]What is up without down
[01:55.39]Or the lost without found
[01:57.63]What is love without a little pain

[02:02.09]Sometimes the one thing you fear
[02:04.37]Keeps on holding you there
[02:06.64]Time for giving up the crying game
[03:04.10]
[03:40.39]And love is amazing when you figure it out!
