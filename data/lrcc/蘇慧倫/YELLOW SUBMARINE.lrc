[00:00.00]YELLOW SUBMARINE
[00:02.00][01:08.00][01:44.00](音樂伴奏)
[00:15.00]IN THE TOWN
[00:17.00]WHERE I WAS BORN
[00:20.00]LIVED A MAN
[00:21.00]WHO SAILED THE SEA
[00:24.00]AND HE TOLD US OF HIS LIFE
[00:28.00]IN THE LAND
[00:30.00]OF SUBMARINES
[00:32.00]SO WE SAILED UP TO THE SUN
[00:36.00]TILL WE FOUND
[00:38.00]THE SEA OF GREEN
[00:40.00]AND WE LIVED BENEATH THE WAVES
[00:44.00]IN OUR YELLOW SUBMARINE

[00:49.00][01:26.00][02:19.00][02:36.00]WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE
[00:53.00][01:30.00][02:23.00][02:40.00]YELLOW SUBMARINE
[00:55.00][01:32.00][02:25.00][02:42.00]YELLOW SUBMARINE
[00:57.00][01:35.00][02:27.00][02:44.00]WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE
[01:01.00][01:39.00][02:31.00][02:48.00]YELLOW SUBMARINE
[01:03.00][01:41.00][02:33.00][02:50.00]YELLOW SUBMARINE

[01:09.00]AND OUR FRIENDS ARE ALL ABOARD
[01:13.00]MANY MORE OF THEM LIVE NEXT DOOR
[01:17.00]AND THE BNAD BEGINS TO PLAY
[01:22.00]IN OUR YELLOW SUBMARINE

[02:02.00]AS WE LIVE A LIFE OF EASE
[02:06.00]EVERYONE OF US HAS ALL WE NEED
[02:10.00]SKY OF BLUE AND SEA OF GREEN
[02:14.00]IN OUR YELLOW SUBMARINE
