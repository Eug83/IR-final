[00:16.03]I was alone
[00:18.78]You came alone
[00:22.02]And gave your heart to me
[00:27.52]And I know but I was scared to tell you
[00:34.43]Just how much How much I need you
[00:40.49]And I wanted I wanted to show you
[00:47.63]Just how much How much I adore you
[00:53.27]
[00:55.20]And then one day
[00:58.00]I heard you say
[01:01.33]You'd always stand beside me
[01:06.47]Then I know I know I had to tell you
[01:13.18]Just how much How much I thank you
[01:19.73]So I found I found a way to tell you
[01:26.74]Just how much How much I love you
[01:32.02]
[02:02.77]And so today
[02:05.82]I want to say
[02:08.93]I'll always stand beside you
[02:14.44]And I swear I swear I'll always love you
[02:21.24]As long As long as you need me too
[02:27.34]And I found I found a way to tell you
[02:36.49]That this song.This song's just for you
[02:43.79]That this song. This song says..I love you
[02:53.21]
