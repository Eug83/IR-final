[00:18.48]I've kissed the moon a million times
[00:22.69]Dancd with angels in the sky
[00:27.32]I've seen snowfall in the summer time
[00:32.24]Felt the healing of the powers above
[00:36.99]世界之大我在什麼地方
[00:41.88]越想你越接近海洋
[00:46.33]你的唇凝聚著月光
[00:50.93]吻著我狂烈的幻象
[00:55.46]I've even seen miracles
[00:59.73]I've felt the pain disappear
[01:04.19]But still haven't seen anything
[01:08.68]That amazes me quite like you do
[02:23.11][01:13.14]
[03:26.33][03:08.17][02:23.76][01:13.93]You bring me up when I'm feeling down
[03:10.89][01:17.02]I'll do it for you
[03:29.67][02:27.04]I'm crazy for you
[03:31.64][03:12.70][02:28.89][01:19.02]You touch me deep you touch me right
[03:16.11][01:22.25]Just for you
[03:34.39][02:31.57]I'll chase the blues away
[03:36.15][03:17.82][02:33.64][01:23.75]You do the things I've never done
[03:40.13][03:21.74][02:37.56][01:27.77]You make me wicked you make me wild
[03:44.71]So why
[02:42.10][01:32.30]Cause baby, baby
[03:46.15]Cause baby
[02:44.56][01:34.80]You're My No.1
[03:48.47]You're My, You're My No.1
[03:53.66][02:48.35][01:38.42]
[01:46.70]I've sailed in a perfect dream
[01:51.26]I've seen the sun make love to the sea
[01:55.86]I've kissed the moon a milion times
[02:00.46]Danced with angels in the sky
[02:04.59]I've even seen miracles
[02:09.45]I've seen the tears disappear
[02:13.87]But still haven't seen anything
[02:18.51]That amazes me quite like you do
