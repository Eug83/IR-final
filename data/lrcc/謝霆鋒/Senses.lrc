[02:04.00][00:17.00]I go bring When I look straight into the sun
[02:10.00][00:23.00]I go deaf when I hear thunders on the run
[02:15.00][00:29.00]But when I sse you sleeping here beside me.
[02:19.00][00:32.00]Life's just begun
[02:21.00][00:35.00]I can tell it to the whole world.
[02:24.00][00:37.00]You're the one I see your shadow cast on the wall
[02:30.00][00:43.00]When the sun shines
[02:32.00][00:45.00]I hear you calling through the window
[02:36.00][00:49.00]when it rains
[02:38.00][00:51.00]I tend to tremble when I start to think of
[02:42.00][00:55.00]just you andl I don't know why.
[02:47.00][01:00.00]There's no reply
[03:02.00][01:06.00]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:07.00][01:12.00]I'm shivering when I'm standing alone.
[03:13.00][01:18.00]A stom is torming deep inside me.
[03:19.00][01:24.00]A hurricane has got a life of it's own.
[03:24.00][01:29.00]It doesn't matter what happens to the weather,
[03:31.00][01:35.00]Without you I'm just falling apart.
[03:36.00][01:41.00]The snow is freezing all my senses,
[03:42.00][01:47.00]When hail falls down,
[03:45.00][01:49.00]Then it's already too late for heartbreak!
