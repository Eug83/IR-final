[00:02.81]謝霆鋒 - Your Song
[03:06.58][00:07.40]
[00:33.31]My gift is my song and this one is for you
[00:45.63]You can tell everybody this is your song
[00:56.57]I hope you don't mind, hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[01:06.45]How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[01:18.29]It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
[01:24.39]I'm not one of those who can easily hide
[01:30.88]I don't have much money but boy if I did
[01:37.65]I'd buy a big house where we both could live
[01:45.98]If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
[01:52.84]Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
[01:59.21]I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
[02:06.04]My gift is my song and this one's for you
[02:14.59]And you can tell everybody this is your song
[02:21.70]It may be quite simple but now that it's done
[02:28.09]I hope you don't mind, hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[02:35.76]How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[02:45.10]Hope you don't mind, hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[02:53.75]How wonderful life is while you're in the world
