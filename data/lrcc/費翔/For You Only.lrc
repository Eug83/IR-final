[00:11.56]Ready to embrace the day as we both break
[00:18.90]When the light stole in
[00:21.55]it found me wide awake
[00:26.38]Wasted from a sleepless night,
[00:28.43]I reach to touch your hair
[00:33.57]Withdraw an empty hand
[02:48.33][02:40.57][00:36.34]for you're no longer there
[02:52.43][00:41.57]In between the silence,
[02:53.83][00:43.40]living is an empty space
[02:58.94][00:48.15]Save the ticking of a clock
[03:01.02][00:51.02]whose hands are sweeping past its face
[03:20.52][03:06.55][02:21.75][02:03.31][00:55.96]And I just don't want to be lonely
[03:26.04][03:10.99][02:26.55][02:08.52][01:01.33]night and day
[03:28.26][03:13.73][02:28.55][02:10.59][01:03.50]But as I look around me,
[03:31.14][03:16.27][02:30.62][02:12.99][01:05.75]I just feel that way
[03:35.43][02:35.78][02:17.27][01:10.01]For you only
[01:19.28]I turn my hand to something that would clear my head
[01:25.70]But I could not forget
[01:29.56]the parting words we shared
[01:33.70]I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace
[01:40.69]But I could not recall the contours of your face
[01:48.18]And, oh, you slipped away before I had the chance to say
[01:54.78]If I did something wrong,
[01:57.40]please tell me I'll accept the blame
