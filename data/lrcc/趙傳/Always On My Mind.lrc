[00:09.62]Maybe I didn't treat you
[00:15.69]Quite as good as I should have
[00:21.63]Maybe I didn't love you
[00:27.60]Quite as often as I could have
[00:33.44]Little things I should have said and done
[00:39.52]I just never took the time

[00:45.86]You were always on my mind
[00:51.69]You were always on my mind

[00:57.39]Maybe I didn't hold you
[01:03.74]All those lonely, lonely times
[01:09.73]And I guess I never told you
[01:15.67]I'm so happy that you're mine
[01:21.44]If I make you feel second best
[01:27.70]Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

[01:33.67]You were always on my mind
[01:39.60]You were always on my mind

[02:45.34][01:44.37]Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
[01:56.54]Give me, give me one more chance
[02:08.07]To keep you satisfied, satisfied  satisfied

[02:21.82]Little things I should have said and done
[02:27.40]I just never took the time
[02:33.62]]You were always on my mind
[02:39.45]You are always on my mind
[02:59.85]You are always on my mind
[03:07.36]Maybe I didn't treat you
[03:13.22]Quite as good as I should have
[03:19.17]Maybe I didn't love you
[03:25.13]Quite as often as I could have

[03:31.22]Maybe I didn't hold you
[03:37.26]All those lonely, lonely times
[03:43.25]And I guess I never told you
[03:49.49]I'm so happy that you're mine
[04:06.76]Maybe I didn't treat you
