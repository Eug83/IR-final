[00:15.01]You can say
[00:19.84]all things must end
[00:21.81]You can smile and even pretend
[00:29.21]And you can turn and walk away so easily
[00:36.27]But you can't say
[00:38.78]you don't love me anymore
[00:43.54]You can dream of what might have been
[00:51.06]You can cry for what won't pass again
[00:57.94]And you can say
[01:01.59]there's every reason you should leave
[01:05.24]But you can't say
[01:07.97]you don't love me anymore
[01:14.74]You can say
[01:17.96]I'm right you're wrong
[01:20.84]You can make your plans to find somebody else
[01:28.95]But I can't believe you can carry on
[01:37.25]We know what should be said
[01:41.05]But you can't find the worlds Instead you say
[01:51.32]All things must end You can smile and even pretend
[02:01.69]And you can turn and say you're leaving me for good
[02:09.85]But you can't say
[02:10.67]you don't love me anymore
[02:30.50]And you can turn and say you're leaving me for good
[02:38.92]But you can't say
[02:42.46]you don't love me
[02:45.02]First just say
[02:46.66]you don't love me anymore
