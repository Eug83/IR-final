[02:49.68][00:25.02] Has anybody here seen my friend Abraham?
[02:59.49][00:35.02] Can you tell me where he's gone?
[03:06.92][00:42.68]
[03:09.51][00:44.87] He freed a lot of people,
[03:13.27][00:48.69] But it seems the good die young,
[03:18.51][00:54.56] I just looked around and he's gone.
[03:26.17][01:01.68]
[03:38.64] But I just looked around and he's gone.
