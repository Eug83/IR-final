[00:29.00] If it were love I would give that
[00:31.42] love every second I had
[00:34.67] And I do
[00:38.22] Did I know where he'd lead me to?
[00:42.03] Did I plan
[00:44.75] Doing all of this
[00:47.03] for the love of a man?
[00:50.02] But I let it happen anyhow
[00:54.00] And what I'm feeling now
[00:57.32]
[00:57.90] Has no easy explanation
[01:01.31] Reason plays no part
[01:05.00] Heaven help my heart
[01:11.48] I love him too much
[01:13.91]
[01:15.57] What if he saw my whole exstence
[01:19.04] Turning around a word,
[01:21.52] a smile , a touch?

[01:38.31] One of these days,
[01:39.88] and it won't be long

[01:44.34] Then he should
[01:48.12] All my dreams will be understood
[01:51.44] No surprise
[01:54.47] Nothing more to learn from
[01:57.25] the look in my eyes
[01:59.50] Don't you know that
[02:01.45] time is not my friend
[02:03.41] I'll fight it to the end
[02:07.18] Hoping to keep that best of moments
[02:10.90] When the passions come
[02:14.31] Heaven help my heart
[02:21.09] The day that I find
[02:24.93] Suddenly I've run out of secrets
[02:28.80] Suddenly I'm not always on his mind
[02:37.58]
[02:41.01] Maybe it's best to love a stranger
[02:46.17]
[02:46.78] That's what I've done heaven help my heart
[02:56.87]
