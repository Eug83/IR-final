[00:00.00] Let It Be Me
[00:16.00]
[00:18.00] 鄧麗君演唱
[00:22.00]
[00:24.00] I bless the day I found you
[00:30.03] I want my arms around you
[00:35.30] And so I beg you:
[00:40.69] Let it be me.
[00:43.99]
[00:45.42] Don't take this heaven from one
[00:51.41] If you must cling someone
[00:56.81] Now and forever,
[01:02.17] let it be me.
[01:05.54]
[02:12.36][01:07.34] Each time we meet, love
[02:17.56][01:12.56] I find complete love
[02:23.21][01:18.28] Without your sweet love,
[02:28.48][01:23.67] what would life be?
[02:32.01][01:27.51]
[02:33.36][01:28.47] So never leave me lonely
[02:39.38][01:34.53] Tell me that you love me only
[03:06.73][02:56.06][02:44.90][01:40.06] And say you'll always
[03:12.19][03:01.03][02:50.55][01:45.29] let it be me.
