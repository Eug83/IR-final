[00:03.19] What A Wonderful World
[00:09.79]鄧麗君
[00:13.40]

[00:17.10]I see trees of green, red roses too
[00:24.40]I see them bloom for me and you
[00:29.73]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.

[00:41.91]I see skies of blue and clouds of white
[00:48.97]The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night

[02:08.63][00:54.34]And I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[02:21.70][01:07.34]The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
[02:27.96][01:12.91]Are also on the faces of people going by
[02:33.24][01:18.69]I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
[02:40.59][01:25.73]They're really saying I love you.

[02:45.71][01:31.18]I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
[02:53.20][01:38.46]They'll learn much more than I'll never know
[02:58.65][01:43.72]And I think to myself what a wonderful world
[01:56.16]
[03:10.22]Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world.
[03:34.55][02:20.53]
