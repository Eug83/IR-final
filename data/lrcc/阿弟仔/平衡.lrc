[00:00.93] 平衡    演唱 : 阿弟仔 　
[00:04.30]編輯：Jimmy    QQ:81854958
[00:21.42]開著車我怎麼選擇　守規則　或者　闖紅燈
[00:25.82]吐著舌滋潤上下唇　早已經亂了　分寸
[00:29.75]這氣氛　我怎麼選擇　要提升　或者　要沉淪
[00:32.92]太矛盾　因為太青春　太容易忘了　自責
[00:36.70]黑色白色間隔　區分好的壞的　我踩在哪一格　我踩在哪一格
[00:42.60]為什麼不漸層　為什麼不混合（混合）
[00:46.85]對的錯的是的非的　黑色白色灰了灰了　灰了

[00:50.85]The devil is tempting me,
[00:51.85]haunting me the angel is watching me eternally
[00:54.52]I'm at the crossroads with the bible
[00:55.39] now I need a role model, not a big apple


[00:57.63]Where should I go ? What do you know?
[00:59.22]Give me the strength to fight my foes
[01:01.17]The number on the wall is 6-6-6
[01:03.04]and I used to be sick sick sick


[01:04.91]Always wonder why he could fise
[01:06.42]and shine dancing beyond the clouds in the sky

[01:08.23]march on , march on ,
[01:09.03] waste on time wake up,
[01:10.71]my man check my rhymes


[01:11.73]Then I realized what he sacrificed
[01:13.43]word for word and truer than true
[01:15.47]mess with me ? mess with my crew! keep it real.
[01:17.78]I'll keep it real with you.

[02:32.69][02:29.18][02:25.59][02:22.16][01:29.09][01:25.55][01:22.04][01:18.61]怎麼開始　自由意識
[02:34.44][02:30.85][02:27.33][02:23.81][01:30.85][01:27.36][01:23.76][01:20.24]怎麼停止　自有意思

[03:29.25][02:36.20][01:32.69]我要怎麼平衡　取捨　
[03:34.17][02:40.82][01:37.83]我的自私與責任
[03:36.64][02:43.90][01:40.50]　A question won't be answered in　the way you loke it answered

[03:39.59][02:46.89][01:43.10]我要怎麼平衡　取捨　
[03:44.69][02:51.76][01:47.74]我的單純與邪惡
[03:47.13][02:54.36][01:50.82]　Why this, why that, so many whys so
[03:48.79][02:55.80][01:52.47]　Why don't you tell me where you at?
[03:50.72]where you at?


[01:53.99]Then it's war and I want it hot he's top,
[01:55.91]so I'm firm klike a rock
[01:57.56]anything you say　will be used against
[01:59.56]you cuz mistakes ain't sweet like orange juice

[02:01.13]Tell me where ya from, where ya going
[02:02.62]In the world we all just keep rolling and rolling the light's beaming,
[02:04.58]so I'm screaming till　they stop thinking that we are daydreaming

[02:08.31]Always wonder why he could fise
[02:09.96] and shine dancing beyond the clouds in the sky
[02:11.71]march on , march on , waste on time
[02:13.39]wake up, my man check my rhymes


[02:15.19]Then I realized what he sacrificed word for
[02:17.08]word and truer than true
[02:18.90]mess with me ? mess with my crew! keep it real.
[02:21.70]I'll keep it real with you


[03:01.13]空氣裡的潮濕 不斷的侵蝕　
[03:03.40]進入我的脖子　進入我的腦子
[03:04.62]能不能解釋　到底是什麼事　
[03:06.21]讓我想誠實　又讓我無恥
[03:07.31]為什麼　一直　我就是如此
[03:09.55]　如此掩飾　又想理智　又像白癡
[03:11.71]是否有空摸索　一次　二次　三次
[03:15.22]身體裡的油脂　不斷的繁殖
[03:17.40]接著我的肌肉　也就開始鬆弛
[03:18.87]能不能解釋　到底是什麼事　
[03:20.30]讓我想憔悴　又讓我放肆
[03:22.02]為什麼　一直　我就是如此　
[03:23.62]如此無知　又想堅持　又想排斥
[03:26.31]是否有空摸索　一次　二次　三次
