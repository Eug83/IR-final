[00:31.31]Oceans apart day after day
[00:37.26]And I slowly go insane
[00:42.15]I hear your voice on the line
[00:47.94]But it doesn't stop the pain
[00:52.85]If I see you next to never
[00:57.85]How can we say forever
[03:17.00][02:01.94][01:03.00]Wherever you go
[03:19.63][02:04.67][01:05.61]Whatever you do
[03:21.75][02:07.00][01:08.01]I will be right here waiting for you
[03:27.28][02:12.49][01:13.35]Whatever it takes
[03:30.22][02:15.25][01:16.50]Or how my heart breaks
[03:32.65][02:17.56][01:18.83]I will be right here waiting for you
[01:30.26]I took for granted all the times
[01:36.07]That I thought would last somehow
[01:40.73]I hear the laughter I taste the tears
[01:46.84]But I can't get near you now
[01:51.49]Oh can't you see it baby
[01:56.85]You've got me going crazy
[02:24.31]I wonder how we can survive
[02:29.55]this romance
[02:34.73]But in the end if I'm with you
[02:39.14]I'll take the chance
[03:07.03]Oh can't you see it baby
[03:11.90]You've got me going crazy
[03:47.13]waiting for you~
