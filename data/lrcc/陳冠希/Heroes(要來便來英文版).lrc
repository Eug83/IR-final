[00:27.68]You feel your body shaking Ten thousand bullets
[00:30.92]racing through your mind It dosen't matter if you live or
[00:35.49]die And that's the reason why you're stil alive
[01:44.38][00:42.85]Now when the walls come crashing The world will leave you
[01:47.41][00:45.98]standing on your own And though the night will fall upon
[01:52.08][00:50.76]soul You'll read the signs to know which way to go
[03:28.30][03:12.74][02:22.81][01:59.78][00:58.30] (Chorus) Heros will never give up They carry on when it's
[03:31.98][03:16.20][02:25.89][02:03.35][01:01.65]rough And that's he way It's should go They see the light
[03:36.49][03:21.04][02:31.22][02:07.26][01:06.60]when it's dark And win the fight when It's hard
[03:39.40][03:23.96][02:34.19][02:11.54][01:09.68]They make it right when everything goes out of control
[01:29.04]Outside the heat is rising You try to keep your head above
[01:33.05]the ground and even though the sky is falling down
[01:38.55]Winning the fight is what it's all about
[02:38.37]take what de take these gen y cops do what de gotta do
[02:39.91]they won't be stopped they hot,you popped,you know you get
[02:42.49]locked comin' at your ass like robocop
[02:43.81]whataa - kickin'back like a kung fu flick
[02:45.24]when you step in the place you know you're hit
[02:47.11]streets are blazin' like the wild wild west
[02:48.87]glazin' amazin' pull the glock outcha chest
[02:52.94]bombs,knives,guns,grenades
[02:54.81]dippin'in'n out movin' out of the shades
[02:56.79]the way the right crime de seem to amaze so yous got to get up
[02:58.77]and give dem their praise
