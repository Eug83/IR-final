[01:38.98][00:17.76]I think  I'm really gonna explode
[01:41.94][00:21.18]The coldness is outside
[01:44.15][00:22.98]But it's red hot inside
[01:46.12][00:25.13]I'll take it further  this time
[01:49.15][00:28.22]Don't pretend that you forgot
[01:51.18][00:30.08]I won't let you slip away
[01:52.94][00:31.84]And if it don't mean much to you
[01:55.75][00:34.54]i'll show ya   How to turn stome into gold
[01:59.60][00:38.78]Oh and i don't take "no" for an answer
[02:03.45][00:42.18]Even this time you say it's over
[02:05.93][00:45.74]Let's get it burning
[02:45.41][02:07.96][00:47.18]Out in the dark  There's nowhere to hide
[02:48.54][02:11.69][00:50.54]Come in the shelter And dance through the night
[02:52.17][02:15.27][00:54.17]Out in the dark  There's nowhere to run
[02:55.86][02:19.01][00:57.74]One night was over  Another's just begun
[02:59.54][02:22.69][01:01.42]Let's take one mistake and  We make it correct
[03:03.17][02:26.27][01:05.04]Let's think about tomorrow
[03:05.04][02:28.14][01:06.97]Forget about when love's gonna end
