You feel your body shaking Ten thousand bullets
racing through your mind It dosen't matter if you live or
die And that's the reason why you're stil alive
Now when the walls come crashing The world will leave you
standing on your own And though the night will fall upon
soul You'll read the signs to know which way to go
(Chorus) Heros will never give up They carry on when it's
rough And that's he way It's should go They see the light
[03:36.49][03:21.04][02:31.22][02:07.26][01:06.60]when it's dark And win the fight when It's hard
[03:39.40][03:23.96][02:34.19][02:11.54][01:09.68]They make it right when everything goes out of control
[01:29.04]Outside the heat is rising You try to keep your head above
[01:33.05]the ground and even though the sky is falling down
[01:38.55]Winning the fight is what it's all about
[02:38.37]take what de take these gen y cops do what de gotta do
[02:39.91]they won't be stopped they hot,you popped,you know you get
[02:42.49]locked comin' at your ass like robocop
[02:43.81]whataa - kickin'back like a kung fu flick
[02:45.24]when you step in the place you know you're hit
[02:47.11]streets are blazin' like the wild wild west
[02:48.87]glazin' amazin' pull the glock outcha chest
[02:52.94]bombs,knives,guns,grenades
[02:54.81]dippin'in'n out movin' out of the shades
[02:56.79]the way the right crime de seem to amaze so yous got to get up
[02:58.77]and give dem their praise
