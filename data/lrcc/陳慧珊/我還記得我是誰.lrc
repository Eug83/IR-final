[00:22.49]彷彿六尺高
[00:25.04]還依稀跳著舞
[00:28.98]你震撼情度
[00:32.60]令俗人極憤怒
[00:36.83]七點未算早
[00:40.37]留下一滴須
[00:44.13]便敏捷地提步
[00:47.68]像烈士上路
[00:51.60]If I knew, the days never be the same
[00:58.35]I'll be never let you go
[01:02.94]I'll be in your arms, missing you
[03:29.99][02:26.61][01:07.56]我還記得我是誰
[03:33.28][02:29.58][01:12.53]曾共你起居
[03:37.13][02:33.25][01:16.14]卻沒法再愛下去
[03:42.27][02:38.57][01:21.93]名與姓
[03:43.85][02:40.14][01:23.09]都知道
[03:44.83][02:41.13][01:24.34]我還記得你是誰
[03:48.17][02:44.47][01:27.47]曾掠過我嘴
[03:52.00][02:48.33][01:31.28]卻沒法再吻下去
[01:39.49]西裝在我家
[01:42.02]黑房裡懸掛
[01:46.22]你某日除下
[01:50.13]右面還滴了茶
[01:54.15]花樽沒有花
[01:57.60]無謂講其他
[02:00.64]尚有國字形臉
[02:05.05]亦隸屬閣下
[02:08.10]There's no one, As so much I loved you
[02:15.82]Can't change my love for you
[02:19.89]Ever can't forget, missing you
[02:56.15]Do the nights and days cure my feel of pain?
[02:59.09]Please somebody, say
[03:00.42]All of my heart is almost cryin'
[03:09.98]In your eyes, in your sight, was it certainly my place?
[03:19.33]Tell me please the reason of your love for me
[03:26.27]Can I cry?
[04:00.53]Shiny days when you were mine...
[04:04.24]Shiny days when you were mine...
[04:08.09]Shiny days when you were mine...
