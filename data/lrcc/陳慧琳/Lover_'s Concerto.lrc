[02:48.10]
[00:30.64][00:00.19]How gentle is the rain
[00:35.24][00:06.06]that falls softly on the meadow
[00:40.61][00:15.80]Birds high up on the trees
[00:43.99][00:21.70]serenade the clouds with their melodies
[00:48.93][00:28.59]Oh
[00:50.29]See there beyond the hill
[00:54.28]the bright colors of the rainbow
[00:59.62]some magic from above
[01:03.17]Made this day for us
[01:05.74]just to fall in love
[01:09.71]You'll hold me in your arms
[01:13.48]and say once again you'll love me
[01:18.87]And that your love is true
[01:22.41]everything will be just as wonderful
[01:37.78]Now
[01:38.94]I belong to you
[01:41.93]from this day until forever
[01:47.22]Just love me tenderly
[01:50.70]and I'll give to you every part of me
[01:55.45]Oh
[01:56.75]Don't ever make me cry
[02:00.82]through long lonely nights without us
[02:06.09]Be always true to me
[02:09.56]Keep this day in your heart eternally
[02:15.99]You hoid me in your arms
[02:19.71]and say once again you love me
[02:25.09]And that your love is true
[02:28.60]everything will be just as wonderful
