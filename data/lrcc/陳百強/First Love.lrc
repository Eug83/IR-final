[00:27.95]Once upon a dream
[00:32.13]When this world isn't what it seems
[00:39.48]My love and I lived inside a smile
[00:45.26]The time was nigh
[00:46.84]We broke down and we cried
[00:53.92]Rcfriending dragonflies
[00:57.74]Lullabyes and funny little rides
[01:05.03]We'd spend the night time
[01:07.78]Counting countless stars
[01:10.54]Choking on our stolen first cigar.
[01:17.01]There is no reason , no rhyme
[01:22.85]No need of keeping track of time
[01:29.29]A life just passing and life just beginning
[01:35.43]First love ensnared my mind
[01:47.06]Wonderland was waiting
[01:50.68]Butterflies went fluttering by
[01:58.25]We wore our raincoats standing in the sun
[02:03.86]One by one
[02:05.84]Good time had just begun
[02:11.80]Quite lost in a trance
[02:15.93]My love and I lost in loving dance
[02:23.33]Turning around and turning again
[02:29.29]Never knowing it had to end
[03:00.41][02:35.71]There is no future no past
[03:06.21][02:41.61]Your first love won't be your last
[03:12.57][02:47.73]First love don't last oh no it won't last
[03:18.52][02:53.51]But it's worthwhile remembering when
