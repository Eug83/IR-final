[00:00.00]A BOWL OF RICE    詞/SHUNZA  曲/SHUNZA & JOE
[00:00.00]TAKIN' MY LITTLE VOYAGE AGAIN.
[00:03.00]THINKIN' BACK INTO MY CHILDHOOD LAND.
[00:06.00]DRINKIN' THE WHITE MILK SHE FORCED ME TO.
[00:09.00]HERSHEY'S CHOCOLATE SYRUP ON SUNDAYS,TOO.
[00:13.00]POURIN'TASTELESS WHITE MILK INTO THE SINK.
[00:16.00]HOPIN' THAT GRANDMA DIDNT SEE ME DOIN' IT.
[00:19.00]COULDNT DRINK NOTHIN' WITHOUT COLOR IN IT.
[00:22.00]HATIN' COLORLESS SOCIETY AND PROVIN' IT.
[00:26.00]WATCHING TOO MUCH T.V FOR A CHINESE GIRL.
[00:29.00]LIVING IN A NEW COUNTRY CALLED AMERICA.
[00:32.00]YES SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,SHE'S GOT HER SPACIOUS SKIES.
[00:36.00]BUT WHAT ABOUT THE UGLY PARTS THE CONQUERORS HIDE?
[00:46.00]A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.
[00:48.00]SHOVIN' IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.
[00:51.00]A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.
[00:55.00]FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.
[00:58.00]SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.
[01:01.00]THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.
[01:05.00]IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.
[01:08.00]EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .
[01:18.00]BEING HIT IN FIRST GRADE BY A LITTLE BLACK GIRL.
[01:21.00]I KNEW SHE FELT TRAPPED IN HER UNJUST WORLD.
[01:24.00]SHE NEEDED SOMEONE TO BEAT
[01:26.00]BECAUSE SHE TOO WAS BEING BEAT.
[01:27.00]BY THE SAME SOCIETY I LEARNED LATER DREADED ME..
[01:44.00]THE EYELINEI WAS BLESSED WITH MADE ME FEEL SUPERIOR.
[01:47.00]WATCHIN'SISTERS SLICE UP THEIRS.WHO FELT INFERIOR?
[01:51.00]THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME WHEN THE EAST MEETS THE WEST.
[01:53.00]A FOGGY GLIMPSE IS WHAT THEY GOT OF 美國 BEAUTIFUL WEST.
[02:04.00]A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.
[02:06.00]SHOVIN IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.
[02:10.00]A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.
[02:13.00]FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.
[02:16.00]SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.
[02:20.00]THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.
[02:23.00]IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.
[02:26.00]EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .
[02:29.00]A BOWL OF RICE IS A BOWL OF MEMORIES.
[02:32.00]SHOVIN'IT DOWN OUR HUNGRY THROATS.
[02:35.00]A CUP OF TEA IS A CUP OF TEARS.
[02:38.00]FLOODIN DOWN OUR THIRSTY THROATS.
[02:42.00]SO I WRITE A SONG TO KEEP.
[02:45.00]THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND ME.
[02:48.00]IT SHALL KEEP US WARM AT NIGHT.
[02:52.00]EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE OUT OF SIGHT .
[03:19.00]
