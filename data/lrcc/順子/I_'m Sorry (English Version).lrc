[00:00.00]I'm Sorry (English Version)
[00:05.00]
[00:29.21]I always think that I know everything
[00:35.95]But you insist I know nothing
[00:44.42]I always fight to have very last word
[00:51.34]But your thoughts were never heard
[00:56.05]
[00:57.61]I'm sorry, so sorry
[01:04.98]Didn't mean to hurt you
[01:12.79]I'll borrow your sorrow
[01:20.44]Don't tell me it's through
[01:27.96]
[01:30.13]I wish I could take back some things I said
[01:36.85]I wish I could make things better
[01:45.31]I wish I could take back some things I did
[01:52.20]Everyday I'm feeling sadder
[01:57.04]
[01:58.53]I'm sorry, so sorry
[02:05.93]Didn't mean to hurt you
[02:13.70]I'll borrow your sorrow
[02:21.29]It's my turn now to cry
[02:27.12]
[02:30.17]Never fear I'll be here
[02:37.79]Say a prayer
[02:40.45]We can take on the hands of time
[02:45.68]And I, I know we can make it
[02:51.80]If we just stay together
[02:56.69]And trust each other on this one

[03:04.98]I'm sorry, so sorry
[03:12.58]Didn't mean to hurt you
[03:20.35]I'll borrow your sorrow
[03:27.88]Don't tell me it's through,
[03:33.84]don't tell me it's through
[03:35.52]Said I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
[03:42.28]I've never meant to, never meant to hurt you
[03:50.71]I'll borrow, I will borrow your sorrow
[03:58.46]It's my turn now to cry
[04:13.75]
