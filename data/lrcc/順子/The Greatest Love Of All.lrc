[00:03.17]The Greatest Love Of All
[00:10.19]
[00:26.02]I believe the children are our future
[00:29.35]Teach them well and let them lead the way
[00:32.91]Show them all the beauty they possess inside
[00:38.96]Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
[00:45.97]Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

[00:55.47]Everybody searching for a hero
[00:59.29]People need someone to look up to
[01:02.75]I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
[01:08.60]A lonely place to be
[01:12.73]So I learned to depend on me

[03:06.66][01:17.65]I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
[03:14.24][01:25.14]If I fail, if I succeed
[03:17.49][01:28.43]At least I live as I believe
[03:21.26][01:32.35]No matter what they take from me
[03:24.77][01:35.89]They can't take away my dignity
[03:29.44][01:40.50]Because the greatest love of all
[03:36.76][01:47.47]Is happening to me
[03:43.96][01:55.32]I found the greatest love of all
[03:51.81][02:03.37]Inside of me
[03:55.37][02:06.94]The greatest love of all
[04:03.40][02:14.51]Is easy to achieve
[04:10.82][02:22.11]Learning to love yourself
[04:15.94][02:27.50]It is the greatest love of all

[02:36.37]I believe the children are our future
[02:39.95]Teach them well and let them lead the way
[02:43.88]Show them all the beauty they possess inside
[02:49.85]Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
[02:57.52]Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be


[04:22.04]And if by chance, that special place
[04:30.69]That you've been dreaming of
[04:38.72]Leads you to a lonely place
[04:44.82]Find your strength in love
