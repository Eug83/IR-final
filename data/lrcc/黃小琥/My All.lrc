[00:10.00](QQ21209302  Power by OinkOink!! )
[00:20.00]
[00:23.15]I am thinking of you
[00:28.88]In my sleepless solitude tonight
[00:34.31]If it's wrong to love you
[00:38.98]Then my heart just won't let me be right
[00:44.68]'Cause I've drowned in you
[00:47.20]And I won't pull through
[00:49.99]Without you by my side
[00:55.70]I'd give my all to have
[01:02.34]Just one more night with you
[01:06.28]I'd risk my life to feel
[01:12.86]Your body next to mine
[01:16.80]'cause I can't go on
[01:21.42]Living in the memory of our song
[01:26.78]I'd give my all for your love tonight
[01:37.38]Baby can you feel me
[01:42.52]Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
[01:47.85]I can see you clearly
[01:53.17]Vividly emblazoned in my mind
[01:58.25]And yet you're so far
[02:00.71]Like a distant star
[02:03.86]I'm wishing on tonight
[02:08.91]I'd give my all to have
[02:15.40]Just one more night with you
[02:19.20]I'd risk my life to feel
[02:25.71]Your body next to mine
[02:29.59]'Cause I can't go on
[02:34.13]Living in the memory of our song
[02:39.35]I'd give my all for your love tonight
[02:50.02](guitar break)
[03:21.69]I'd give my all to have
[03:28.21]Just one more night with you
[03:32.24]I'd risk my life to feel
[03:38.94]Your body next to mine
[03:42.84]'Cause I can't go on
[03:47.63]Living in the memory of our song
[03:52.81]I'd give my all for your love tonight
[04:03.75](I'd) give my all for your love
[04:12.58]Tonight
