[00:00.00]DESPERADO
[00:05.18]齊秦
[00:10.06]
[00:19.67]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[00:28.09]You been out ridin' fences for so long now
[00:36.21]Oh, you're a hard one
[00:39.06]I know that you got your reasons
[00:43.76]These things that are pleasin' you
[00:49.25]Can hurt you somehow

[00:54.91]Don' you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
[00:58.79]She'll beat you if she's able
[01:02.26]You know the queen of heats is always your best bet

[01:09.85]Now it seems to me, some fine things
[01:14.48]Have been laid upon your table
[01:18.42]But you only want the ones that you can't get

[01:26.17]Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no youger
[01:34.10]Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
[01:42.34]And freedom, oh freedom well
[01:47.98]That's just some people talkin'
[01:50.34]Your prison is walking through this world all alone

[02:00.17]Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
[02:04.86]The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
[02:08.93]It's hard to tell the night time from the day
[02:15.59]You're loosin' all your highs and lows
[02:20.96]Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

[02:30.25]Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
[02:40.49]Come down from your fences, open the gate
[02:47.94]It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
[02:56.57]You better let somebody love you
[03:00.52](Let somebody love you)
[03:04.13]You better let somebody love you
[03:11.57]Before it's too late
[03:21.13]
