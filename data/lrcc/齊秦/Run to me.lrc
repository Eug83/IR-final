[00:09.37]Run to Me
[00:27.68]齊秦
[00:32.48]If ever you got rain in your heart,
[00:37.21]someone has hurt you, and torn you apart,
[00:44.49]am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
[00:52.15]And let it be like they said it would be -
[00:57.73]me loving you girl, and you loving me.
[01:03.93]Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love
[01:10.15]Run to me whenever you're lonely.
[01:16.75]Run to me if you need a shoulder
[01:23.31]Now and then, you need someone older,
[01:29.48]so darling, you run to me.
[01:39.12]And when you're out in the cold,
[01:43.90]no one beside you, and no one to hold,
[01:49.85]am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?
[01:58.13]And when you've got nothing to lose,
[02:03.33]nothing to pay for, nothing to choose,
[02:09.56]am I unwise to open up your eyes to love
[02:15.74]Run to me whenever you're lonely.
[02:22.07]Run to me if you need a shoulder
[02:28.53]Now and then you need someone older,
[02:34.79]so darling, you run to
[02:41.76]Run to me whenever you're lonely.
[02:48.13]Run to me if you need a shoulder
[02:54.58]Now and then, you need someone older,
[03:01.26]so darling, you run to
[03:07.81]Run to me whenever you're lonely.
[03:14.19]Run to me if you need a shoulder
[03:20.75]Now and then, you need someone older,
[03:27.13]so darling, you run to me.
