[00:03.47]齊秦      longer
[00:21.13]編：上衫達也
[02:34.81][00:29.33]Longer than,there've been
[02:37.11][00:31.48]fishs in the ocean,
[02:40.82][00:35.29]higher than,any bird ever flew.
[02:46.67][00:41.27]longer than,there've been stars
[02:49.50][00:44.23]up in the heavens.
[02:52.21][00:46.48]I've been in love with you.
[02:58.17]I am in love with you
[00:53.14]stronger than,any mountian
[00:56.30]cathedral,
[00:59.24]true than, any tree ever grew,
[01:05.13]deeper than,any forest primeval
[01:10.44]I am in love with you.
[01:16.39]I'll bring fire in the winters,
[01:22.58]you'll send showers in the spring,
[01:28.51]we'll fly through the falls and
[01:32.79]summers,with love on our wings.
[01:41.16]though the years,as the fire stars
[01:44.72]to mellow,buning line in the book of
[01:50.01]our lives.
[01:52.32]though the binding cracks, and the
[01:55.11]pages start ti yellow.
[01:58.24]I'll been in love with you.
[02:04.09]I'll been in love with you.
