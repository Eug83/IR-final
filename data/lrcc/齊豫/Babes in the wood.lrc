[00:18.25]Big bad wolf at the window
[00:18.49]Not much choice in the mater now
[00:18.72]Some must lead,some must follow
[00:18.99]
[00:19.22]Touch can mean distance to some people
[00:19.44]Touch can mean prison or be like a cage
[00:19.67]I always thought that life could be more simple
[00:19.90]Especially in this day and age
[00:20.13]

[00:23.30]The world's getting weird,the wolf's running free
[00:23.52]But that's another story,this is their story
[00:23.74]
[00:23.96]But touch can be a blessing to other people
[00:24.19]Touch can bring blossom to things that decay
[00:24.64]I think life should be that simple
[00:26.06]Especially in this day and age
