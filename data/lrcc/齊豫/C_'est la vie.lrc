[00:01.00]              C'est La Vie  -----  by  Chyi YU
[00:22.00]C'est la vie
[00:26.00]Have your leaves all turned to brown
[00:30.00]Will You scatter them around you
[00:35.00]C'est la vie
[00:39.00]Do you love
[00:42.00]And then how am I to know
[00:46.00]If you don't let your love show for me
[00:51.00]C'est la vie
[03:53.00][03:45.00][02:09.00][02:01.00][01:04.00][00:55.00]Ah.....C'est la vie
[04:01.00][02:17.00][01:11.00]Who knows
[04:03.00][02:19.00][01:13.00]Who cares for me
[04:12.00][02:25.00][01:20.00]C'est la vie
[01:24.00](break)
[01:28.00]In the night
[01:32.00]Do you light a love's fire
[01:36.00]Do the ashes of dires for you remain
[01:44.00]Like the sea
[01:48.00]There's a love too deep to show
[01:52.00]Took a storm before my love flowed for you
[01:57.00]C'est la vie
[02:35.00](break)
[03:12.00]Like a song
[03:16.00]Out of tune and out of time
[03:20.00]All I need was a rhyme for you
[03:25.00]C'est la vie
[03:29.00]Do you give
[03:32.00]Do you live from day to day
[03:36.00]Is there no song I can play for you
[03:41.00]C'est la vie
