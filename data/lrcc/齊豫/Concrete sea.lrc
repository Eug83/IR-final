[00:00.81]I heard some music being played today
[00:07.97]I heard a song but the words were wrong
[00:08.42]if didn't matter to me anyway
[00:08.69]some people looking to the sky today
[00:08.92]
[00:09.10]I started looking to the sky today
[00:09.31]cause it's so big and it's so far away
[00:09.50]I've got too many things insid my head
[00:09.68]I wish that I could be up there instead
[00:09.86]
[00:10.05]CHORUS
[00:10.23]no one is meant to be living here in a concrete sea
[00:10.58]everyone including me ,wishes he could be set free

[00:10.95]there I looked into the ocean blue
[00:11.09]cause it's so deep and it's so quiet too
[00:11.48]there just too many people everywhere
[00:11.62]I wish that I was down there
[00:11.80]

[00:12.57]about a man and just how he got away
[00:12.79]you've got to leave the things you grow up for
[00:13.02]turn your head and start to swim for shore
