[00:00.73]cry,cry,cry without tears
[00:06.20]cry in silence so nobody hears
[00:06.43]the people are so distant
[00:06.61]nobody wants to help
[00:06.84]I am caught up in emotions
[00:07.10]that I had never felt
[00:07.28]if I try to explain
[00:07.51]the torment that I feel
[00:07.72]they think that I'm pretending
[00:08.08]they don't know what I mean
[00:08.26]
[00:08.49]CHORUS
[00:08.89]
[00:09.16]I don't know who I am now
[00:09.38]I feel I'm torn apart
[00:09.60]life is jusy a battle
[00:09.83]where I can't win the fight
[00:09.97]I think fate wasn't fair
[00:10.19]it dealt this card to me
[00:10.37]I have inside two forces
[00:10.55]that always disagree
[00:10.78]
[00:11.00]CHORUS
[00:11.30]
[00:11.51]cry,cry,cry without tears
[00:11.69]cry in silence nobody hears
[00:11.97]tearless,speechless
[00:12.15]with this pain
[00:12.38]forever silent I'll remain
[00:12.63]
[00:12.89]I look at my reflexion
[00:13.12]and don't know who I see
[00:13.56]It's like a passing stranger
[00:14.31]staring back at me
