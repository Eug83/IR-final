[00:36.49]I stand alone in the darkness
[00:43.70]The winter of my life came so fast
[00:51.07]Memories go back to childhood
[00:58.26]To days I still recall
[01:05.33]Oh, how happy I was then
[01:12.93]There was no sorrow,  there was no pain
[01:20.22]Walking through the green fields
[01:27.40]Sunshine in my eyes
[01:33.72]I』m still there everywhere
[01:37.08]I』m the dust in the wind
[01:40.74]I』m the star in the northern sky
[01:48.12] Never stayed anywhere
[01:51.75]I』m the wind in the trees
[01:55.38]Would you wait for me forever
[02:11.45]
[02:21.93]
[02:31.50]I』m still there everywhere
[02:34.94]I』m the dust in the wind
[02:38.57]I』m the star in the northern sky
[02:45.78] Never stayed anywhere
[02:49.53]I』m the wind in the trees
[02:53.16]Would you wait for me forever
[03:01.05]Would you wait for me forever
[03:08.40]Will you wait for me forever
