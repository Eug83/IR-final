[00:18.16]Midnight
[00:20.60]Not a sound from the pavement
[00:24.56]Has the moon lost her memory
[00:28.49]She is smiling alone
[00:33.43]In the lamp light
[00:36.03]The withered leaves collect at my feet
[00:40.70]And the wind begings to moan
[00:47.77]Memory
[00:50.37]All alone in the moonlight
[00:54.30]I can smile at the old days
[00:58.48]I was beautiful then
[01:02.85]I remember the time I knew what happiness was
[01:10.39]Let the memory live again
[01:17.68]Every street lamp
[01:21.57]Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
[01:33.72]Someone mutters and a street lamp gutters
[01:41.42]And soon it will be morning
[01:50.14]Day light
[01:52.62]I must wait for the sunrise
[01:56.47]I must think of a new life
[02:00.76]And I musn』t give in
[02:05.02]When the dawn comes ,tonight will be a memory too
[02:12.64]And a new day will begin
[02:25.15]
[02:37.01]
[02:50.22]Burnt out ends of smoky days
[02:58.17]The stale cold smell of morning
[03:06.11]A street lamp dies, another night is over
[03:14.12]Another day is dawning
[03:22.64]Touch me
[03:25.15]It』s so easy to leave me
[03:29.14]All alone with my memory
[03:33.27]of my days in the sun
[03:37.94]If you touch me
[03:40.89]You』ll understand what happiness is
[03:46.51]Look, a new day has begun
[04:10.74]  (end)
