[00:00.00]this is the turning of the year
[00:23.84]the final scene before the curtain falls
[00:24.02]the squirrel warm within his bed of leaves
[00:24.21]can not hear the wind that blows around the chimney pots
[00:24.39]are like the pilgrim of the year gone by
[00:24.59]he sliips
[00:24.77]once he was a young man
[00:24.91]who loved in the spring
[00:25.30]and lay beneath the upturn sky on long hot summer days
[00:25.48]but with autumn he grows mellow
[00:25.62]he looks over his shoulder down the long year path of no return
[00:25.80]already he's but a memory fading like a shadow on the wall
[00:25.98]but time with restless footsteps hurries by
[00:26.15]and now beside the road
[00:26.32]there stands the pilgrim of the year to be
[00:26.50]falling leaves turn to gold
[00:26.73]silver flowers on my window
[00:26.91]spirit of the fading year gently slips away
[00:27.14]he knows not where
[00:27.32]he cannot see
[00:27.50]
[00:27.71]naked trees in the sky
[00:27.94]stars are shinning clear and cold
[00:28.12]minstrel of the ages sings of words so long ago
[00:28.30]that age-old tune without a name
[00:28.49]no one knows
[00:28.67]
[00:28.85]in the white falling snow
[00:29.04]the pilgrim travels on
[00:29.21]his face toward the sun
[00:29.43]beyond the open road he travels on
[00:29.60]pass the lamp shinning windows
[00:29.81]faces by the fire
[00:30.17]before the midnight hour
[00:30.40]christmas time has come around again
[00:30.58]
[00:31.39]go to sleep little child
[00:31.75]go to sleep little child you shouldn't be awake
[00:32.00]go to sleep little child
[00:32.39]time to let the night go by
[00:32.67]waiting for the sound of a magic sleigh
[00:33.03]the chimney is not too tall they say
[00:33.30]or the roof too high for a reindeer to fly
[00:34.15]no not too high for a reindeer to fly
