[00:02.00]Song and Silhouettes

[00:21.00]See how the night has fallen
[00:26.00]Fallen upon you and me
[00:32.00]See how its cloak has covered us
[00:38.00]Guarding our my mysteries

[00:44.00]And how the stars are sinking
[00:50.00]Sinking below you and me
[00:55.00]Lost in a dream of oblivion
[01:01.00]Lost in the shimmering sea

[03:00.00][01:06.00]As the wind flies over the world unseen
[03:06.00][01:12.00]Lilac eyes shine in the dark
[03:11.00][01:18.00]And with the rise and fall of our unspoken dreams
[03:18.00][01:24.00]She gathers us into her arms with
[03:50.00][03:26.00][01:32.00]Songs and silhouettes
[04:01.00][03:38.00][01:50.00]Songs you won't forget

[02:14.00]Feel how the world is floating
[02:20.00]Floating around you and me
[02:25.00]Feel how the air is whispering
[02:31.00]Secrets of eternity
