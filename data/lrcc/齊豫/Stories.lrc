[00:04.22]（獨白）
[00:07.52]I remember quite clearly now when this story happened
[00:12.39]The autumn leaves were floating and measured down to the ground
[00:16.79]Recovering the lake where we used to swim like children
[00:22.12]On the sun would dare to shine
[00:25.81]That time,we used to be happy
[00:29.11]Well,I thought we were
[00:32.31]Bnt the truth was that -- You had been longing to leave me
[00:37.36]Not daring to tell me
[00:41.05]On that precious night watching the lake vaguely conscious
[00:49.00]You said: our story was ending
[00:55.45]
[01:02.29]Now I』m standing here
[01:05.21]No one to wipe away my tears
[01:08.73]No one to keep me warm
[01:11.63]And no one to walk along with
[01:16.44]No one to make me feel
[01:19.75]No one to make me whole
[01:23.38]Oh ! What am I to do ?
[01:30.92]I』m standing here alone
[01:34.06]It doesn』t seem so clear to me
[01:38.27]What am I supposed to do about this burningheart of mine
[01:45.26]Oh ! What am I to do ?
[01:48.67]Or how should I react ?
[01:52.39]Oh ! tell me please !
[01:57.06]（獨白）
[02:03.23]The rain was killing the last days of summer
[02:07.82]You had been killing my last breath of love
[02:11.18]Since a long time ago ......
[02:16.48]I still don』t think I』m gonna male it through another love story
[02:21.51]You took it all away from me
[02:25.77]And there I stand , I knew I was gonna be the ...
[02:31.09]The  one left behind
[02:34.51]But still I』m watching the lake vaguely conscious
[02:43.50]And I knew ----
[02:46.50]My life is ending
[02:48.97]
[02:59.19]Now I』m standing here
[03:02.19]No one to wipe away my tears
[03:05.72]No one to keep me warm
[03:08.59]And no one to walk along with
[03:13.31]No one to make me feel
[03:16.67]No one to make me whole
[03:20.39]Oh ! What am I to do ?
[03:27.79]I』m standing here alone
[03:30.87]It doesn』t seem so clear to me
[03:35.05]What am I supposed to do about this burningheart of mine
[03:42.27]Oh ! What am I to do ?
[03:45.41]Or how should I react ?
[03:49.18]Oh ! tell me please !
[03:53.73]Ha ----
