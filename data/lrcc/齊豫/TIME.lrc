Time

[00:17.00]Today I'm closing up the house
[00:21.00]cause it don't feel like home
[00:24.00]The harder twilight pulls at me
[00:29.00]the less I wanna go
[00:32.00]They say that all the streets of heaven
[00:36.00]are paved with gold
[00:40.00]That's just to hurry up us folks
[00:44.00]That get too old

[00:49.00]Time gets me wound up
[00:52.00]like a clock inside my head
[00:57.00]Time gets me spinning my own wheels
[01:05.00]And when I think that there ain't one more inch
[01:09.00]this worn out heart can give
[01:13.00]Time's gonna teach me how it feels

[01:26.00]Watch your hands they don't get caught
[01:30.00]I'm bout to close this door
[01:34.00]You bright young kids are all I got
[01:39.00]and now I know what for
[01:41.00]You'll see that love's the only thing
[01:45.00]we're got to show
[01:50.00]Time will just run out but love I know

[01:58.00]Time gets you wound up
[02:01.00]like a clock inside your head
[02:06.00]Time gets you spinning your own wheels
[02:14.00]and while you're losing what you found
[02:17.00]you're finding out that's what you need
[02:22.00]Time's gonna teach you how it feels

[02:29.00]I know your father's watching
[02:32.00]He's saving me a place right by his side
[02:38.00]And that you don't like to hear that kind of talk
[02:45.00]But it ain't up to me to hide
[02:54.00]Don't make it hard for me to go
[02:58.00]Don't make it hard for me

[03:15.00]This house has seen some fifty years
[03:19.00]Atop the same old soil
[03:24.00]But houses are just houses child
[03:28.00]Its people are what's loyal
[03:31.00]You'll see that love's the only thing
[03:34.00]We're got to show
[03:40.00]Time will just run out but love I know

[03:48.00]Time gets you wound up
[03:51.00]like a clock inside your head
[03:56.00]Time gets you spinning your own wheels
[04:04.00]and while you're losing what you found
[04:08.00]you're finding out that's what you need
[04:13.00]Time's gonna teach you how it feels
