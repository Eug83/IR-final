[00:00.00]The Rose
[00:15.00]discography: Wonderful World      (1997)
[00:05.00]Words & Lyrics: Amanda McBroom
[00:10.00]Vocal: Sandy Lam/Chyi

[00:26.75]Some say love
[00:30.52]It is a river
[00:35.39]That drowns tender reed
[00:42.55]Some say love
[00:46.49]It is a razor
[00:51.44]That leaves your soul to bleed
[00:58.73]Some say love
[01:02.36]It is a hunger
[01:07.38]That endless aching need
[01:14.81]I say love
[01:18.54]It is a flower
[01:23.07]And you it's only seed
[01:30.77]
[01:34.69]It's the heart afriad of breaking
[01:43.18]That never learns to dance
[01:50.53]It's the dream afriad of waking
[01:58.99]That never takes the chance
[02:06.43]It's the one who won't be taken
[02:14.91]Who can not seem to give
[02:22.43]And the soul afraid of dying
[02:30.83]That never learns to live
[02:38.75]
[02:42.23]When the night has been too lonely
[02:50.21]And the road has been too long
[02:58.24]And you think
[03:02.30]That love is not only for the lucky and the strong
[03:14.72]Just remember in the winter
[03:22.72]Far beneath the bitter snow
[03:30.57]Lies the seed
[03:34.20]That with the sun's love
[03:38.61]In the spring becomes the rose
[03:48.58]
