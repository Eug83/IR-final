[00:02.00]Wishful Milenio

[00:50.00]Come milenio,let there be doors to beauty
[01:02.00]Come milenio,let there be cure for spite
[01:14.00]No more disguise,simplicity thrives
[01:19.00]Be weight ss so we can fly
[01:25.00]Right under the stars,a voice from afar
[01:31.00]A key I have placed in your heart

[01:40.00]Come milenio,the answer lies in the question
[01:51.00]Come milenio,beyond the despair there is hope
[02:03.00]The desert may bloom,bewilder the fool
[02:08.00]so much is left unrevealed
[02:15.00]You haven't a clue,a womb or a tomb
[02:20.00]Look into a flower you'll see fruit

[02:29.00]Come milenio,many fire make peace with water
[02:41.00]Come milenio,a fist ends with open hand
[02:52.00]Remember the flames,forget not the pains
[02:58.00]Lest we make the same mistake
[03:04.00]Surrender the grudge,embrace the unloved
[03:10.00]The curses no longer beheld

[03:19.00]Come milenio,many tears shed not out of sorrow
[03:32.00]Come milenio,may we cherish what we've borrowed
