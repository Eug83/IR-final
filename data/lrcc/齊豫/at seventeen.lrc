[00:10.00]At Seventeen

[00:16.00]I learned the truth at seventeen
[00:20.00]That love was meant for beauty queens
[00:24.00]And high school girls with clear siknned smiles
[00:28.00]Who married young and then retired
[00:36.00]The Valentines I never knew
[00:40.00]The Friday night charades of youth
[00:44.00]Were spent on one more beautiful
[00:49.00]At seventeen I learned the truth

[00:56.00]And those of us with ravaged faces
[01:00.00]Lacking in the social graces
[01:04.00]Desperately remained at home
[01:08.00]Inventing lovers on the phone
[01:12.00]Who called to say Come dance with me"
[01:16.00]And murmured vague obscenities
[01:20.00]It isn't all it seems at seventeen

[01:27.00]A brown-eyed girl in hand me downs
[01:31.00]Whose name I never could pronounce
[01:35.00]Said"Pity please the ones who serve,
[01:40.00]They only get what they deserve"
[01:46.00]And the rich relationed home town queen
[01:50.00]Marries into what she needs
[01:54.00]With a guarantee of company and haven for the elderly

[02:06.00]Remember those who with the game
[02:10.00]Lose the love they sought to gain
[02:14.00]In debentures of quality and dubious integrity
[02:22.00]The small town eyes would gape at you in dull surprise
[02:29.00]When payment due exceeds accounts received at seventeen

[03:20.00]To those of us who knew the pain
[03:24.00]Of Valentines that never came
[03:29.00]And those whose names were never called
[03:33.00]When choosing sides for basketball
[03:40.00]It was long ago and far away
[03:44.00]The world was younger than today
[03:48.00]And dreams were all they gave for free
[03:53.00]To ugly duckling girls like me

[03:59.00]We all played the game and when we dared
[04:04.00]To cheat ourselves at solitaire
[04:08.00]Inverting lovers on the phone
[04:12.00]Repenting other lives unknown
[04:15.00]They call and say "Come dance with me"
[04:20.00]And murmur vague obscenities
[04:24.00]At ugly girls like me--at seventeen
