[00:00.00]I have a dream of my own
[00:06.61]and it's mine and mine alone
[00:06.75]it's been my friend since I was just a girl
[00:07.10]if has a life,it has a heart,as a soul
[00:07.41]and that's a part of everything this woman gives the world
[00:07.58]
[00:07.95]and it's a big dream
[00:08.08]big enough to share
[00:08.44]like a rainbow hanging in the air
[00:08.76]and I thand god for making it come true
[00:09.33]makes me think maybe god's a woman too
[00:09.51]makes me think maybe god's a woman too
[00:09.69]
[00:09.86]there's a full moon tonight
[00:10.04]and I'm bathing in its light
[00:10.22]naked as the day that I was born
[00:10.40]there is no shame beneath this sky
[00:10.59]I have kissed the past good-bye
[00:10.77]and mended up my broken heart so torn
[00:10.99]
[00:11.36]with a sweet sound only I can make
[00:11.61]and it gets stronger with every breath I take
[00:11.84]and it's all a part of making me feel new
[00:12.11]makes me think maybe god's a woman too
[00:12.59][00:12.32]makes me think maybe god's a woman too
