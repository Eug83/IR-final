[00:00.00]you touched my life
[00:05.48]with your softness in the night
[00:05.66]my wish was your command
[00:05.84]until you ran out of love
[00:06.06]tell myself I am free
[00:06.25]got a chance of living just for me
[00:06.38]no need to hurry home
[00:06.56]now that you're gone
[00:06.74]
[00:06.92]CHORUS
[00:07.14]knife cuts like a knife
[00:07.32]how will I ever heal
[00:07.50]I'm so deeply wounded
[00:07.68]knife cuts like a knife
[00:07.87]you've cut away the heart of my life
[00:08.05]
[00:08.27]when I pretend wear a smile to fool my dearest friends
[00:08.46]I wonder if they know it's just a show
[00:08.73]I'm on a stage
[00:09.39]day and night I go through my charades
[00:09.61]but how can I disguise
[00:09.84]what's in my eyes
[00:10.05]I've tried and tried
[00:10.46]locking up the pain I feel insid
[00:11.04]the pain of wanting you,wanting you
