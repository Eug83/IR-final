[00:18.71]She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
[00:25.44]She must be hurt very badly.
[00:30.62]Tell me what's making you sad, Li ?
[00:37.25]Open your door, don't hide in the dark.
[00:42.65]You're lost in the dark, you can trust me,
[00:47.86]'Cause you know that's how it must be.
[00:56.49]Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

[01:08.84]Her eyes like window trickle in rain
[01:15.67]Upon the pain getting deeper
[01:20.77]Though my love wants to relieve her.
[01:27.07]She walks alone from wall to wall,
[01:33.16]Lost in her hall she can't hear me,
[01:37.78]Though I know she likes to be near me.
[01:46.47]Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.

[02:57.94]There must be more I can tell her
[03:03.17]If she really wants me to help her.
[03:09.03]I'll do what I can to show her the way
[03:14.67]And maybe one day I will free her
[03:19.92]Though I know no-one can see her.
[03:28.50]Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.
