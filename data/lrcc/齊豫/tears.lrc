[00:00.10]TEARS 齊豫
[00:29.50]All alone I have started my journey
[00:35.60]To the darkness of darkness I go
[00:41.20]With a reason,I stopped for a moment
[00:47.00]In this world full of pleasure so frail
[00:51.80]Town after town on I travel
[00:57.70]Pass through faces I know and know not
[01:03.40]Like a bird in flight,sometimes I topple
[01:08.40]Time and time again,just farewells
[02:21.80][02:43.60][01:13.20]Donde voy,donde voy
[01:19.10]Day by day,my story unfolds
[02:32.70][02:54.50][01:24.20]Solo estoy,solo estoy
[02:49.10][01:29.90]All alone as the day I was born
[01:38.60]Till your eyes rest in mine,I shall wander
[01:43.80]No more darkness I know and know not
[01:48.90]For your sweetness I traded my freedom
[01:54.80]Not knowing a farewell awaits
[02:00.30]You know,hearts can be repeatedly broken
[02:05.30]Making room for the harrows to came
[02:11.00]Along with my sorrows I buried
[02:16.10]My tears,my smiles,your name
[02:27.30]Songs of lovetales I sing of no more
[02:38.70]Once again with my shadows I roam
[02:59.80]Still alone with my shadows I roam
